	<div class="content is-size-6-tablet is-size-5-desktop is-size-4-widescreen mt-5 pt-2"><p>It was 2 a.m. I was woken up from my sleep by a numbing cold that crept up my left leg. I shivered despite the layers of warmth provided by my sleeping bag and my thermals. The air was still. Frost had formed on top of our tent. I turned to my side with great discomfort and tried to close my eyes to go back to sleep again. But the cold kept reminding me of the long night; the several hours of darkness and gloom before the sun would appear. Sleep was a luxury that I had started yearning for each night. Just then, I had this terrible urge to pee. I told myself to just go back to sleep and not think about it. Just the thought of leaving the relative warmth of my sleeping bag for even a few minutes was crushing. The only warmth inside our tent was painstakingly generated and conserved by our own bodies. Going outside would immediately turn the sleeping bag cold and I would have to start all over again. With slow movements, I unzipped my sleeping bag, immediately feeling the colder air hitting my body, through my thermals. I turned on my headlamp, wore my jacket and track pants and crouched on my knees, slowly crawled out of the entrance of the tent, to wear my boots. Once outside, I could feel the chill air, several degrees colder. Once I stood outside the tent, I forgot the drudgery, the cold, as I raised my head to look at the starry skies. I lost myself for a few moments, becoming one with these stars, high above, glowing like a thousand small lamps, warming my heart and drawing me into their magical, endless world. As much as I hate stepping out of my tent, I have enjoyed these moments of complete solitude; the brief periods of time when I truly become one with nature and forget my existence.</p>
<p>Vast stretches of nothingness spread out in all directions. We were walking with our backpacks; four of us, in a single file. I looked down and kept one foot in front of the other, counting my steps. There was no scenery, no snow capped mountains around for inspiration. The sun was shining bright. It was about mid-noon and I was getting hungry. We were nowhere near civilization yet. The wind lifted fine dust off the ground. The air was hazy. The entire landscape was nothing but shades of brown with no vegetation. We were walking on tiny rocks and pebbles that made me want to remove my boots and massage my feet. I dreamt of dipping my feet in warm water. All I wanted was to peel off all the layers of clothing, throw away my backpack and jump into a warm pool of water. But I had chosen this instead; to walk for eighteen days braving inhospitable weather, bone numbing cold and brief hours of sun. I was here because something inside me compelled me to come here. I was not promised great treasures or glory. What I set out to see were beautiful mountains. All I wanted was, to be surrounded by the largest peaks on earth. But what I had to trade for this view was hours and days of walking, painstakingly moving foot by foot, enduring sleepless nights, altitude sickness and stretches of loneliness, away from loved ones. When I finally returned from this trek, what I missed the most was the simplicity of my existence, the stillness of my mind, the hours of meditative silence and the sense of detachment I could achieve — to materials, to people, to familiar places, to comforts. It was the ease with which I was able to throw away the need for all these that surprised me.</p>
<p>We two, ours two. Two people with two backpacks; and all that we needed fit into these two large backpacks. It was our home; the tent, our bed, the sleeping mats, the sleeping bags, four pairs of clothes, snacks for energy, water bottles, medicines, reading / writing material, tools, headlamps, toiletries. That is about all that we ever needed to live. I got so used to this frugal lifestyle that once back from travel, I started living out of these bags; the simple functional clothes (although for a few days I couldn’t even look at them) that I carried and wore sufficed my need. My whole life started feeling temporary. The traveller mind stayed on with me long after I was done travelling. Travelling was not just the need to experience new places or enjoy the scenery. It was uncomplicated life; of living in the moment; sleeping at different places each night; setting up home and dismantling it every now and then; a limited set of possessions, all functional, every piece adding value, nothing fancy, nothing redundant, most importantly, nothing missed. I feared attachment; I loathed permanence. I hated the word “settled”, I still do. I enjoyed being on the move, I enjoyed brief and meaningful interactions with strangers, to whom I felt so connected knowing very well that I would never contact them ever again in my life. In those fleeting interactions, we would have shared the most deep, the most personal thoughts, which even years of living together might not have facilitated.</p>
<p>These are some of the aspects of travel that defines my need to travel. It is difficult to say whether I was already this way or travel made me like this. Which came first? The chicken or the egg? I feel that every travel experience has moulded me; changed me into something that I carry permanently with me, deep inside. The adventure, the thrill, the excitement of seeing new places, setting foot on new continents, experiencing local cuisines and cultures; all these no doubt offer compelling reasons to travel. These were why I was inspired to travel in the first place. Nevertheless, these are still superficial. To come back from a travel unchanged, with some photographs and some happy memories is to me just scratching the surface. I find it impossible to return to my older life, to go about mundane day to day activities, go back to an older routine, to not let the travel penetrate my every action, every thought henceforth. When people ask me how the “trip” was, I struggle to find words to express myself. The simple reason being that they are now addressing someone who is not the same person anymore. So I do not consider travel experiences as some external entity that I can go to and return from; like an overcoat that I wore for sometime and then took off. It is like food; something that I ate and digested and now it is part of my body, my thoughts, my being; it became me.</p>
<p>The moments of triumph on reaching the Everest Base Camp, the magical moments of witnessing the Milky Way and millions of stars under a dense black sky at Neil Island, the beautiful sunsets at Ko Yao Nai, the experience of falling asleep hearing the constant sound of waves in Cartagena, getting lost in the vast Wadi Rum with nobody around, watching the mountain gorillas play with their young at Bwindi, hearing the panting of a tired cheetah that chased a gazelle without success in the Masai Mara, watching a huge blue whale almost toss our boat into the Indian Ocean, these are so many, and these are what make my life exciting and worth living. These are the reason why I would readily endure harsh weather, walk miles without water, carry backpacks that tear into my shoulders, ignore the aches and pains, sit in crowded buses, endure bad food, no food, upset stomachs; all this for brief moments with nature where I can truly get lost. These brief moments, that dot my travel landscape like bright shining oases, moments that I can carefully store away in my memories, to relive, play and extend them endlessly in my mind for comfort during difficult times. The oases offer me the strength to move on with my pursuits. But the desert that surrounds these oases, the vast nothingness of hardships, of drudgery, grueling times of boredom, these are the scaffolding that support me in my life. It has taught me to be patient, balanced, stoic when fear creeps, when sadness engulfs, when confusion muddles the mind, when situations push me into depression. I know that I have built the strength to crawl out of such inescapable life situations. But most importantly, it has taught me to put things in perspective; to weigh out the good and the bad, to see through layers of deceit, to see the real value of relationships, to not get carried away or not let my ego gallop ahead of me.</p>
<p>Take the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown for instance. Almost everyone I have spoken to thus far, have expressed their restlessness, their boredom, their irritation of being static in a place, of not being able to go out to meet people or to go to a restaurant. In many ways, I can sense their deep urge to just get out of their home, to get a change of scenery, to just walk down crowded streets; it comes out unguarded in conversations. Even when we are seriously discussing how people need to understand their responsibility towards fellow human being, loved ones and how unnecessary movement, venturing out should be avoided as much as possible, a sudden “but I am tired of just being locked up”, “I just want all this to end so I can go out” or something on those lines derailing our conversation, abruptly. When I tell them that I somehow never felt a need to go out, they seem to agree overtly but I do not fail to catch their bewilderment that they are carefully yet unsuccessfully trying to hide away.</p>
<p>In these four months, I haven’t been out more than about four times, all of which have been to visit my elderly parents and spend some time with them. And I am able to stay sane and have enough things to do without ever getting “bored”, and somehow haven’t missed the going out or meeting people a bit. I seem to be content with this confined life within my house. Of course, I am lucky to be living in a house surrounded by greenery with a lot of birds and creatures. My day is mostly spent writing, reading or watching nature. What I do miss is an opportunity to see some of the natural wonders of the world, which I would have pursued if conditions were different. But given the situation, I could adapt to the polar opposite lifestyle. I was surprised that I could stay still, day after day, doing the same things, without being driven crazy. I now associate this ability to my travel learnings; the times when I had to focus on just putting one foot in front of the other, with nothing more to look forward to. I had learnt to live with limited resources, drastically cut down on my lifestyle and become frugal and minimalist, with pleasure.</p>
<p>While traveling, things do not always work out in my favour, there are many disappointments, missed chances, denied reservations or entries and all this I have learnt to swallow and move on. When I look at my life itself as a journey, I can see this lockdown as a minor setback, a no-entry sign to a national park that I had meticulously planned for months to visit. I am not affected by the fact that I have to stay at home and not move around. What I fear for is the future, a world where pandemics might become the new normal, a world which will see countries becoming more guarded, more hostile and untrusting of each other, a fight for resources, a world where the injustice is heightened, where the poor cannot live anymore, where wildlife and nature become casualties of increased human pillage. That is what saddens me. I try to shift my focus inwards; to look at my relationships, my friendships, my bonds with loved ones. To be thankful for each day that went by without turning into a nightmare; to find the smaller joys, like sitting still for hours and watching the rain, to work with the soil and see a plant sprout, to enjoy a simple, sumptuous meal; to be empathetic towards people who cannot afford to sit at home during the lockdown, who have to go out and work to live through another day. To not complain about what I cannot do and focus on what I am able to do.</p>
<p>That I have learnt from my travels.</p>
<p>And for that, I am thankful.</p>
