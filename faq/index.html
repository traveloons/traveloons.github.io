                            <h3 id="why-the-name-vasudaiva-kutumbakam">Why the name ‚ÄúVasudaiva Kutumbakam‚Äù?</h3>
<p>Vasudaiva Kutumbakam is a phrase from the Indian Philosophical text, the Maha Upanishad. The close-to-literal English translation of this would be : ‚ÄúThe world is just one family‚Äù.</p>
<p>While the phrase itself has meaning and context within the spiritual, historical and ethical realm, we have used it here in a very different sense. In fact we might have expanded on it to mean more than what it intended originally.</p>
<p>If one reads the phrase within Indian Philosophical context ‚Äì both the original text as well as the commentaries ‚Äì the notion of this world-family is mostly anthropocentric. The phrase is also quite metaphysical and less about the material realities.</p>
<p>We on the other hand used the phrase to include some real-world, pragmatic ideas such as removal of borders, dissolution of states and expanded on the family to include all life and non life in nature. For us the phrase includes the practicalities about being a family, about sharing, about equity and about love.</p>
<h3 id="so-this-website-is-about-a-new-philosophy">So this website is about a new Philosophy?</h3>
<p>We don‚Äôt presume so. We only intend to document our own beliefs, ideas and thoughts, combined with our ethics and politics into an easily (hopefully) understandable structure so that we can share it with you. You can call it philosophy in one sense but that can be a bit of a heavy title for what we are trying.</p>
<h3 id="agreed-but-it-is-sort-of-like-a-library-isnt-it">Agreed. But it is sort of like a library isn‚Äôt it?</h3>
<p>You could call it a library or a resource with both philosophical and material leanings. We call it an online-resource mostly but we might also use the term website if it makes sense once in a while.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-big-deal-about-calling-it-a-blog-or-a-website">What is the big deal about calling it a blog or a website?</h3>
<p>We consider calling it a website very reductive. An online blog or website form is the present-day tool to engage in the human endeavour of thinking, debating, formulating etc. It wasn‚Äôt that way before and need not be the tool of the future. In person, books, journals, magazines, study-circles there are many other ways we humans share ideas. So we chose to not call it by such names.</p>
<p>Moreover, blog was something we did not want to call it. Our content is not random musings or disconnected thoughts. Nor do we promise content with regularity. The modern form of the diary while did bring us together in some ways, also led to a whole lot of issues and expectations on the Internet; things we don‚Äôt believe in or cater to. To keep things simple, we call this an online-resource.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-curious-now-where-do-i-begin">I am curious now. Where do I begin?</h3>
<p>So you are here for the first time eh? We were just about wondering why you were spending so much time on this FAQ page. Do yourself a favour then and visit the Start Here page for an idea about how we are organized and what we have on offer. Or, you could read on.</p>
<p>NOTE: This page, our FAQ section was built originally with questions that we thought you might have. But do reach out to us via our Contacts page and as we converse, we might find the need to update this page with new material.</p>
<h3 id="i-glanced-at-the-content-why-are-there-so-many-advertisements">I glanced at the content. Why are there so many advertisements?</h3>
<p>Well. We have hosted this at wordpress.com for now off the free plan. We will probably stay here for long till we feel that the content is mature enough to deserve some money to be spent on it. WordPress has to put advertisements for the free plan they offer. Some day when we are hosted on our own website, no one will be forcing ads into our text. Rest assured.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-host-it-yourself-will-you-not-monetize-based-on-advertisements-then">When you host it yourself, will you not monetize based on advertisements then?</h3>
<p>No we won‚Äôt. In fact advertisements, the role of money and our exploitative economy that monetizes and appropriates knowledge are far from escaping our strong critique. You might find one or two essays on that topic around here. We actually strongly believe there isn‚Äôt any knowledge in the world that belongs to a person, a community or to both at a given instance in time.</p>
<p>Everything that we all say or do is actually because of billions of years of learning. We simply stands on the shoulders of giants and presume we are tall. That kind of egocentric approach is what got us here in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="alright-phew-big-sermon-there">Alright. Phew. Big sermon there.</h3>
<p>Sorry. We are passionate that way; getting all preachy and defensive sometimes. Especially when accused of making money off such stuff. üôÇ Did you have a question?</p>
<h3 id="ah-yes-how-often-do-you-update-your-content">Ah yes. How often do you update your content?</h3>
<p>Good question. We have few promises to make. Just like you, we are learning new things everyday in our lives by just living it. It also does not help that we live in times of so much flux and conflict, which means there is so much to unlearn and learn on a daily basis.</p>
<p>While all of this need not instantaneously make it here we will try to ensure we add new content and update old ones as and when required. We might also delete older irrelevant content once in a while. We are trying to live a life that minimizes energy consumption and Internet being an invisible energy-hog is usually not available to us all the time. So there are some technical challenges also to keep things updated very regularly.</p>
<p>As we understand it, wordpress.com, where we are hosted right now might have features such as subcriptions through which you can opt for being notified. As we progress, we might find other ways keep you posted. If you went to the Contacts page and are friends with us now, we might already have added you to some mailing lists.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-share-your-content-with-others">Can I share your content with others?</h3>
<p>Of course. That is the point. Also, feel free to share it as you like. Share links, copy-paste it, screenshot it, do whatever you like. We don‚Äôt really care about conventional notions such as ‚Äúgiving the credit‚Äù. This is as much yours as it is ours.</p>
<p>But if you do share in ways that people come back here to the site, then you and us will make new friends and we could debate together. It would also mean they will choose to subscribe to both the content as well as the concept and/or become part of a community. So there are indeed some larger benefits to not copy-pasting and screenshotting and Whatsapping (are those valid terms?).</p>
<h3 id="do-you-publish-these-elsewhere">Do you publish these elsewhere?</h3>
<p>Not everything but some of the good quality essays we have sent to other publications. It is another matter if they get published or not. If there are other copies of it on the Internet, then will make an explicit note of it and let you know, especially if you share it.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-provide-feedback">How do we provide feedback?</h3>
<p>As hinted earlier, please use the Contact page for information on the best ways to reach out to us.</p>
