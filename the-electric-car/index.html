<p>Some consider climate change as the beginning of the end; some say it is the end
stage of Capitalism. It could be both since there is a distinct possibility that
humanity will end, knowing nothing but Capitalism in all its seductive, mutated
future-forms. Regardless of how we perceive these sequence of events or whether
we consider these issues as economic, social or political, our immediate
action has tremendous bearing on our future. Personal and collective action
towards mitigating the effects of climate change is a no-brainer. What is complicated
however, is the web of inter-linkages between the motivations and methods and
the various dead-ends that exist in the pathways towards the goals that we seek.</p>
<p>Our immediate response when we seek action in this regard is to find ways to
continue doing what we think is normal albeit with minor changes to the
input-parameters involved. So we try to consume this-instead-of-that and to go
here-instead-of-there. We switch and swap our loyalty and to feel good before we
go to bed. This has resulted in an entire vocabulary of sorts. One of the words
involved is &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;. &ldquo;Is there an alternative?&rdquo; we ask. &ldquo;Alternative this
and alternative that&rdquo; we are told. Do we realise that the obsession of ours
with the word will end up nurturing the next strain of Capitalism?</p>
<h2 id="the-boys-who-cried-wolf">The boys who cried &ldquo;Wolf!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>From time immemorial there have been divisions in the society over various
matters. The way we live, conduct, communicate; our belief systems and ethics;
whom we mate with and why; and what-not. Being a species that is torn between
the primeval need to cooperate and a conditioned need to compete, we are naturally
aligned to various schools of thought. The differences also extended to how we
envisioned our relationship with other creatures of this planet and the planet
itself. It is no surprise that we did not choose to respond or react to the
cries made by the earliest radicals. From the Luddites to the commune-seekers;
from the Tolstoys to the Gandhis; although we like them all in our history
books, we rallied behind them only sporadically, if at all.</p>
<p>Even today, there is a concern that those talking about climate change are not
being listened to. There are various reasons cited for this and one of them
is the dismissal to hint that &ldquo;these treehuggers have always behaved this way&rdquo;.
The accusation is that we cried Wolf for too long and too much. How much we
wish we were wrong! But documented data worth a century and real-time data from
today validates the historic and present claim that there is an anomaly in
nature and it is going out of control. Also, all of this is not just physical data
such as measurement of rainfall or temperature. There are social, economic and
political conditions out there (almost in every country) symptomatic of the
disease we have.</p>
<p>We (in a historic sense) have always been talking-about and listening-to
the right things when it came to warnings. There was always a real Wolf; one that
picked up a few helpless and weak sheep once in a while, thereby enabling the rest
of the flock to survive for a few-more-years at a cost. Today, in the year 2020,
nothing changes. We pretend not to be listening because we hope that a few more of
those weak sheep will be taken away to secure resources for the others (including
us). Our move is based on the presumption that we are far from the Wolf. We will
be very wrong.</p>
<p>While the talking and the listening were happening and we can clearly correlate that
with actual data indicative of the issues, what has never happened is personal
and collective action in large numbers to make the necessary
steering corrections. It is also possible that some of us could not have performed
any action at all and there were others - even worse-off - whom the system has kept
at the bottom so that they wouldn&rsquo;t even hear the wolf-alarm.</p>
<h2 id="whose-action-is-it-anyway">Whose action is it anyway?</h2>
<p>If there is one trend that carries through from years of talking, listening
and not-acting-upon, it is the act of pointing fingers at each other. Considering
that the system does keep a few of us at the downright-bottom at all times, it
is important to emphasize that the accusation of pointing fingers is directed
at the privileged. For the sake of this argument, let us consider everyone whom
we call middle-class and higher to be privileged. Another method would be to say
that if a person can put food on the table even without an adequate amount of
physical labour, then he/she is privileged.</p>
<p>It would be foolish to expect the super-rich to have taken any action in a
Capitalist system. It is the fundamental goal in the system to stay right on
top or to go higher, and any action would only work detrimental to this goal. So quite
expectedly, the ones right at the top of the pyramid who knew entirely too well
what a change to the system means; they pointed fingers at the larger population
including the unprivileged. The need to keep Capitalism alive and hence
pollute/deplete was justified with an earnest face and phrase &ldquo;for common good&rdquo;.
Being in the upper echelons of power, some of us were being &ldquo;nice to the others&rdquo; by
throwing in &ldquo;hard earned wealth&rdquo; behind polluting industries and extractive
policies.</p>
<p>It would be odd, isn&rsquo;t it? If overtly a small segment of the population among us
just don&rsquo;t do anything at all. So some of us hatched plans with numerous optics
and theatrics that resulted in the genesis of new words, why, the genesis of an
entire industry around &ldquo;doing good&rdquo;. &ldquo;corporate social responsibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;non
governmental organizations&rdquo;, charities, &ldquo;compassionate capitalism&rdquo;; theatrics
aplenty.</p>
<p>The middle-class (lower, middle, upper) among us pointed fingers in both directions.
When some did not, the system conditioned them to comply. After all the middle-class
is a life-philosophy that enables one to accrue wealth without risks that comes with
being rich or poor. Many among us did not (do not) understand what a systemic-change
means but are selfish enough to desist action because we think we will go higher
up in the pyramid. So sometimes we pointed fingers at each other, thereby feeding
newer forms of hate-politics and creating new templates for politicians. Communal,
regional and caste divides; protectionism and parochialism; entirely new political
leaders and messiahs were born as a result of the middle-class' inability
to grasp and digest the truth.</p>
<p>The onus of doing &ldquo;something different&rdquo; always was with us, the middle-class. But
sadly, this larger population which also includes the very people who have kept the
conscience alive have hardly taken significant personal action. We have either
kept quiet or worked around in such a way that we seem like we are doing great things
but without personal sacrifice. We learned to look busy towards saving the planet
so that we can point fingers at others (who are not busy like us or who are
supposedly not listening).</p>
<h2 id="seeking-alternatives">Seeking alternatives</h2>
<p>As suggested earlier, one classic method of avoiding personal sacrifice has been to
explore &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;. The individual-thought behind this is simple. &ldquo;Can I
continue to sit on my privileges by pretending to make a dramatic change
with sufficient optics and industry backing but with almost nil cost and effort to
me?&rdquo;. Also &ldquo;Can I look like I am taking action even though I am too lazy/indifferent
to actually act?&rdquo;. Hence, in reality &ldquo;alternative this&rdquo; or &ldquo;alternative that&rdquo;
actually only means to find an &ldquo;alternative victim&rdquo;. &ldquo;Which sheep shall get picked
up by the Wolf instead of me?&rdquo; is the real question that we have. And most of us
are happy if we are the spared sheep, even if temporarily. This attitude is the reason
why we will yet again end up playing into the hands of Capitalist forces that are
waiting for an excuse to build the &ldquo;Alternative Capitalism&rdquo; empire.</p>
<p>Our misunderstanding of &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; is actually of lesser worry when compared to
how the Capitalist bosses think about it because as we rally behind the new icons
of environmentalism or mobilize people ourselves for the next big challenge, they
are busy drawing up a master-plan. The moment the word was uttered, it had become a
marketable entity for the eternally greedy. &ldquo;Alternative&rdquo; will share the hall of fame
with &ldquo;Green&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eco-friendly&rdquo; where it will languish forever, representing our
hubris and stupidity combined.</p>
<p>Our entire known history is studded with symbols and motifs that reminds us of
human innovation and capabilities. True to that tradition, &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; also
have had such symbols. From tiny solar powered lamps to induction cookers, we
recognize &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; today by these representatives. However, all those
products cannot hold a candle to the pop-icon of the &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;, i.e the
&ldquo;Electric Car&rdquo;. The electric car stands out as the next aspiration-inducing
entity for the masses; the next walkman; the next smartphone.</p>
<p>There is a big catch though. Ideas can be good. Ideas can be timely. Ideas can be
feasible. For an idea such as the electric car to actually save us from ourselves,
it had to be good, timely and feasible all at the same time. Arriving decades
later than it should have, the electric car is anything but timely. Feasibility of
an idea can be understood in many ways. The narrowest possible understanding of
it is what is commonly accepted; such as the profitability of the electric car,
its brand-value and the rise in stock in relation to this idea. But by feasibility
we should actually mean if there are natural and human resources combined to
make it happen, after sparing essentials for everyone who share this planet with
us. And the answer is a big NO.</p>
<p>The electric car thus represents an idea that is good, yet not timely or feasible.
It is but one example of the &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;. In fact most of our alternatives
fall under the &ldquo;good&rdquo; category but are never timely or feasible. That is one theof
the reasons why we find it so hard to debate or dissuade the emergence of these
ideas. When we have the entire humanity and the planet staring at misery, it
is very challenging (and unempathetic) to look someone in the eyes, someone really
enthusiastic to solve the problem, someone as concerned as us and tell them that
their idea won&rsquo;t take off. We are an innovative species, our ideas ought to be
good in principle -  most of the time - when the well meaning among us come up
with it. But the timeliness and feasibility is what we need to consider.</p>
<h2 id="from-electric-cars-to-nuclear-power-plants">From electric cars to nuclear power plants</h2>
<p>If time and resources are our problem and not a dearth of ideas then our ideas
themselves have to be bounded by these restrictive forces that are currently
out of our control. We as contemporaries who currently share this planet which
includes the set of problems we are presented with do not need to feel ashamed
about not being able to come up with original ideas or feel dejected that our
ideas (which are good inherently) are not realistic. It would do us good to take
inspiration and move on to create things that are realistic and appropriate
for our times.</p>
<p>But that is not what the market and media will tell us. Today they have the
electric-car, tomorrow they will have something else to sell to us. By siding
with the first unrealistic idea we would have paved the way for them to continue
selling us the next unrealistic one, then the next and so on; a rabbit hole
through this wonderland. They will tell us that the sales of electric cars
&ldquo;looks promising&rdquo;, then they will tell us the entire &ldquo;world&rsquo;s economy improved&rdquo;,
&ldquo;people are having new jobs&rdquo;. This will slowly lead to &ldquo;demand for electric
vehicles&rdquo; and ultimately a trough occurs where there is a &ldquo;demand for energy&rdquo;.
Now they will pitch us-against-us because this new demand for energy will be
achievable only if we accept some nuclear power plants or lithium extraction
that can have geo-political impact, or is simply hazardous to some of us.
Little would we notice that the future demand-for-energy will be more than
the projected demand-for-energy (today) and this would be a direct result of
our own ideas that under trying circumstances should have made things better.</p>
<p>This is true about all our alternative ideas. Alternative methods of farming,
solutions in small-scale production, organic and &ldquo;earthy&rdquo; consumer durables,
dietary choices, clothing, schooling, health-and-wellness and even career
choices. Our obsession to replace some entity that consumes a certain
amount of energy with yet another &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that supposedly consumes lesser
energy (for us, or as per our perception) has led to a dangerous pattern and
school of thought. This in fact has made &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; a good word, so much
so that it is cool today to talk about alternatives. People in mansions
talking about alternative lifestyles, young men and women opting for what
they think are &ldquo;alternative jobs&rdquo; etc. Some of us now lay claims to leading
simple lives simply because we think we have embraced alternatives. We are
deluding ourselves to great comic relief.</p>
<p>The mad quest for alternatives without introspecting on our personal stake
and contribution to the problem will only end up aggravating the problem. We need
to be vigilant, skeptical and suspicious about ourselves and of a market that
sings songs that we like, if we intend to truly make any difference. And we
can trust the market and the highest powers to do everything they can, pull
every string, play all known dirty games to maintain status quo. So the only
realistic action remains in the hands of the individual. You and me.</p>
<h2 id="unlearning-alternatives">Unlearning &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As clear as water is the fact that Capitalism is in a big crisis. We were made
promises that &ldquo;everything will be okay&rdquo; by nice looking gentlemen who were
polite by nature and looked like they knew what they were talking about. You
know? Whom we call &ldquo;decent&rdquo; people. Like us. Around us. So we built this world
with the idea that we were doing &ldquo;something good&rdquo;. The crisis now pushes those
gentlemen to a corner. They don&rsquo;t like to be cornered. So as is expected they
would react by forming new conglomerations, merging the economic into the social
and political, forming dangerous concoctions such as Fascist states.</p>
<p>We tend to use Fascism as a benchmark only because we know no worse; we ought
to be careful. What the United States is experiencing under the evergreen cloak
of Democracy or what India is experiencing thanks to the work of Hindu nationalists
might be the worst yet and still without a name. The world, run by corporations
as expected uses anything from mediocrity to religion and use populism to constantly
stay in power, messaging this out via some of the worst leaders the world has
seen. One of the noticeable attributes of such a world is the hatred it has
for the words dissent or protest. Such a world scares us but it is a
conformist&rsquo;s utopia.</p>
<p>In such a world, sowing the seeds for getting away from these alternatives is the
first challenge. Our initial attempts to do this are going to be taken as a
protest or dissent. After all, when we switch from &ldquo;this to that&rdquo; we are still
agreeing to participate in the economy (whatever form of it exists in the society
we live in). We are supposedly still &ldquo;contributing&rdquo;. When we sign-out or slow-down
we are going to look like we aren&rsquo;t contributing anymore. In a world that is
progressively getting corporatized and that shuns dissent, this action would be
deemed criminal soon. If we seek alternatives, that is a sure sign that we are
non-conformists, hence it is in our own interest that we remain so.</p>
<p>What is the alternative for alternatives then? To answer that, let us first understand
once again what it is not. The alternative to consumerism is not some eco-friendly
version of it. The alternative to fossil-fuels is not some green-version of it. The
alternative to eating meat is not mock-meat. The alternative to drinking milk is
not soy-milk. The alternative to flying is not the roads. The alternative to sugar
is not jaggery. An endless list and as we unravel it, it only gets too personal. It
is essential to get past the &ldquo;what it is not&rdquo; to arrive at what it could be.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-say-no-with-conviction">Learning to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; with conviction</h2>
<p>What is a realistic alternative to alternatives? Sacrifice, of course. Giving up.
Saying &ldquo;I want lesser&rdquo;, saying NO, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it&rdquo;. The temptation to
claim &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; by giving up this-for-that should be avoided and real sacrifice
embraced. The beauty lies in the simplicity of this personal action but the large
Everest like mountain that is created in our psyche cannot be ignored. We are
conditioned to think &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; is something painful and hence most of us easily
avoid this (because we can afford to) and many of us also use pretence to shy
away from the responsibility.</p>
<p>It is as simple as that. Sacrifice. Saying NO. We can easily begin by saying
&ldquo;I need less&rdquo;. From the inane of things to the largest decisions, a NO goes a long
way as personal-action from us. Take the plastic-straw as an example. The same old
rehashed environmental consciousness, especially in the wealthy western world has
now brought the &ldquo;eco-friendly and paper-made&rdquo; straws into our lives. Along with it cames
endless serious and humorous debates on its usability. Did we need all this? Do we
have the time for it? If only the consumer said NO to the straw. There will be a
billion personal/comfort reasons for saying YES to it, but just one reason is good
enough to say NO. The seeking of the alternative in such a case has simply
diverted attention from the real issues.</p>
<p>The alternative to consumerism is buying less or not buying at all. The alternative to
drinking milk is not drinking milk. The alternative to fossil fuels is using
lesser amounts of it and travelling lesser. The alternative to eating meat is
to eat less meat. The alternative to a growing middle-class and privileged
population is to cut down on creating a middle-class, privileged populace by
choosing to have less children or no children. There is no rocket science involved
in the personal power to say NO. Alternative is a marketable word, Sacrifice is
not. Hence, no one can sell us options to be part of an exploitative and extractive
world if we choose not to participate in it.</p>
<p>But beware. We can only list out here what we know today. The word &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;
and its mascot the &ldquo;electric car&rdquo; were used above only because that is what the
world understands today. The world is changing as we know it and fast. The kind of
situation we are in will drive in entirely new and imaginative (yet evil) thought
very soon and we need to be able to assess and act on patterns that might emerge.
So it is also important not to get hung up on terms and motifs as we know them today.
Anything can be appropriated or hijacked. We need to be wary that the people who
are winning and writing the history of the world are always a few
steps ahead. We want to be ahead, for sure but we aren&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>There was a phase in the United States of America when the youth said a big NO
to being boxed into categories and to cookie cutter life. The industry did
take a dent. You know what happened later? They made Individualism into a marketable
thing and sold it to the same generation. That was possible because we did not
go far enough; we did not go with conviction and perseverance. It simply means,
there are forces out there to appropriate anything. &ldquo;For the people who say NO!&rdquo;,
some future tagline will read. And we will buy and gulp it whole. That is the
tragedy. In a hyper-Americanized world, even sustainability comes in a canned
tin with an expiry date on it.</p>
<h2 id="personal-and-collective">Personal and Collective</h2>
<p>We always seem to mix up what is to be done in person by us and what needs to be
done as a community. The result of which is that we get nothing done as the years
pass by. Unlike what is commonly understood, the effect of the collective action is
not a sum of its parts (many personal actions). To use an example, if the impact
of one person using less meat is X, then the effect of one thousand people using
less meat is not 1000X. It depends.</p>
<p>This is because we begin from inequality and inequity. But it is not only that.
Even if we presume this world had zero issues related to inequality and inequity,
such actions would not scale in a linear fashion. Hence we need to see ourselves
as two kinds of participants. In one case it is the individual cause of taking
some personal action towards the problem. In the second, participating in what
is feasible and agreeable as a community towards a collective sacrifice. To use
an example again, this might mean the middle-class among us choose to use lesser
fossil-fuels but if we also happen to live in a community/town/city that still
needs fossil fuels, then the collective action might be to decide not to cut
trees anymore.</p>
<p>The all or nothing approach from our end only makes it tougher for us to take any
action. Sometimes it brings in resignation in the form of the  &ldquo;even I won&rsquo;t do it
now since others are not joining me&rdquo; statement. Instead, we need to persist regardless
of whether we find others walking with us or not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we see the extremes flourishing today. Either we are all being herded
in large groups towards religions, nationalities or political ideologies where we
quickly blend into large, uniform voices with predefined collective actions. Or
we are obsessing about the personal with zero value for the collective; My life
changed; my lifestyle change; I do farming now; I grow my own food; I am apolitical;
I am neutral; I am non-violent etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-litmus-test-for-real-change">The litmus test for real change</h2>
<p>Our economic model and even our participation in it is overseen by a distinct
vocabulary; a chirpy, positive stream of thoughts and words. Words like win, grow,
succeed, obtain, procure, compete, higher, taller etc. For a change, what we need
to try and imagine is just the opposite. That has to start with the fairytale called
the electric car. It has to &ldquo;fail&rdquo; so that humanity can &ldquo;succeed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Would it mean that the idea itself failed? Need not be. We are human beings; we are
capable of better ideas. Out of the failure of the electric car will bloom thousands of
ideas that will hopefully be also timely and feasible; the best among us will
ensure that our ingenuity will be put to good use.</p>
<p>It would also mean that we would have put the good parts of an electric car assembly
into equitable use. Instead of putting all that energy and time into using electricity
for driving the middle-class and the rich around, we could use it for something better,
for something essential. The failure of the electric will ensure that a very strong
message is sent across to the larger powers; that &ldquo;all alternative ideas are not
are not marketable&rdquo;. Most importantly, when the pop-culture symbol of alternatives
fails, we would have salvaged something within us that calls itself human;that we are
not merely the economic-man as the system wants us to believe; that we have
truly evolved.</p>
