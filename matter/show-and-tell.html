<div class="content mt-5 pt-2"><p>The professor, ever so gently, placed two large beakers on the table. While the students giggled and settled down into their seats, he proceeded to pick up a large can.</p>
<p>“Class. Look now. Here. I fill this one with water” he said.</p>
<p>He filled up one beaker to about half its volume. There was some murmur in one corner of the classroom. It was evident that the setup was familiar for a few in the classroom.</p>
<p>“Now I fill the other one with alcohol” he said, while picking up another can with clear liquid that looked like vodka.</p>
<p>There were hushed-discussions and general disorder in the room as he poured the contents of the can into the second beaker. A few boys in the classroom made gestures to their female interests, who then giggled.</p>
<p>The initial thud when the professor put a wooden box between the beakers, and the silence that followed was broken by him when he said</p>
<p>“I have two lizards here. Now observe”.</p>
<p>He opened the box, pulled out one lizard and dropped it into the beaker with water. He put the other lizard into the beaker with vodka.</p>
<p>“Class. Observe carefully” he said.</p>
<p>The lizard in the water seemed to be alive even after about 5 minutes had passed. While it was failing at getting out of the beaker, it made repeated attempts to do so every few seconds. The other lizard lie there, motionless.</p>
<p>“The lizard in water survived” the professor said. “But if you noticed, the other one died. Do you know what that means?”</p>
<p>“It means alcohol kills creatures in our stomachs sir”. Someone had indeed read the old joke.</p>
<p>“No” the professor replied, drowning out the laughter.</p>
<p>“It means alcohol is not good for us sir”. A boy managed to say this and sit down amidst the booing that ensued.</p>
<p>“No”. The professor said again.</p>
<p>After what was a long pause, the professor spoke again.</p>
<p>“It means that you have all become part of a system of authority that if needed can make you witness injustice and play the role of willing accomplices when a poor defenceless creature is murdered, where you don’t even attempt to dissuade the injustice from occurring but will participate in the theoretical analysis of it. It means you have gone too far from the basic tenets of what makes us human”</p>
<p>The trailing sound of the professor’s shoes as the he walked out of the lab underscored the vacuous silence in the room.</p>
