<div class="content mt-5 pt-2"><p>Deepavali, the festival of pollution is round the corner. The narrative, dialogue and overall theatrics around firecrackers have never changed over the last three decades. The tabloids masquerading as newspapers usually start the year’s common-minimum on this topic with the “harmful effects of firecrackers” on one page while allowing for adverts to run subtly on another. There will be awareness campaigns started by individuals or concerned groups and collectives. The family get-togethers and dinners will have the firecracker topic as the chief-guest. And since about two decades now, the Internet has been inundated with articles and appeals on the various aspects of firecracker use and misuse. Nothing changes.</p>
<p>In 2018, our plan seems to be to follow the Supreme Court order to restrict the usage of firecrackers to 2 hours between 8pm and 10pm (pan India with a few exceptions) and also mandate the use of “green firecrackers” (Delhi only). Green firecrackers are the result of the research by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). It is claimed that these new-age avatars would reduce particulate matter emissions by 30–35% and sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by 35–40 percent. The Supreme Court order stands not just for Deepavali but also for other religious and cultural events that encourage and facilitate the practice of bursting firecrackers.</p>
<p>While some of us continue to rationalize and innovate the “role of firecrackers” in socioeconomic context and defend them, global warming and climate change continues to take us downhill on a path that can only worsen our current predicament. The “debate on firecrackers” comes only weeks after the “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” (IPCC) released the “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C” (SR15) which asks for radical and unprecedented socioeconomic and lifestyle changes. How are we to put into practice any of the “desired pathways” from the IPCC SR15 which calls for collective rationality, objective analysis, subjective compromise and overall austerity to address climate change?</p>
<p>Let us take a hard look at the Supreme Court ruling itself. We need to appreciate that research did go into a “green firecracker” but can it solve the larger problem? The research has academic value but a 30–40% reduction in emissions would be useful only if the net total emissions can be reduced. For that, the total population and the purchasing power should remain a constant; which is not the case. The population-growth per decade in India is around 25%. The middle-class has grown by 100% in a single decade. Thus, it is easy to deduce that there will be many people purchasing firecrackers every other year and a whole lot more “aspiring” for it; sometimes even taking out loans to purchase them. Simply put, reduction of 30 percent odd emissions does nothing from the point of view of the environment. As for the time-window restriction, it does have a measurable positive impact; that of reduced noise-pollution during the stipulated period. But the effect of a sudden upsurge of both noise and air pollution after that is yet to be understood.</p>
<p>Those who feel betrayed or offended by the Supreme Court ruling have their reasons. Some of them are cited below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court’s intrusion into cultural matters</li>
<li>A time-window proposal that is not representative of the diversity of cultures</li>
<li>Loss of livelihood in the firecracker industry</li>
<li>Cost implications of “green firecrackers”</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above reasons rest on solid foundations of rationale, but only in isolation. We are being mollycoddled when we need a Supreme Court to intervene in cultural matters; we should have risen to the occasion and changed ourselves. The time-window seems too western and rigid for a country that has a civilization that precedes many of the (now naturalized) concepts of calendars and time; when nature was the governor of “what is to be done when” and different biospheres decided the time for the appropriate activity. In addition to that, implementation of the time-window in a country where two time-zones are long overdue, does not seem scientific at all. The fear that many will lose their livelihoods due to the closure of these industries is real/legitimate and so are the predictions about the cost increases that will result from manufacture of “low emission” firecrackers.</p>
<p>The “true cost” (resource consumption, human suffering, air pollution, greenhouse gases, displacement etc.) of all commodities including firecrackers has always been hidden behind the smokescreen provided by money. Hence, a cost increase towards green firecrackers barely checks-and-balances the long history of “hidden subsidy” that is borne by the weakest creatures on the planet including the planet itself. The cost will also act as a deterrent for purchase, thereby helping us keep the net total emission under check; a quasi-carbon-tax if you will. Firecrackers when looked at as a “cultural/religious/patriotic right” arouses passion but we need to start looking at it as “yet another product” of consumerist movement which leaves exploited people and destroyed nature on the wayside. It can probably be shown that the projected cost of even “trying to fix” our planet is a gazillion times more than this minor cost increase.</p>
<p>The loss of livelihood is a serious problem and it will also have political implications. It will not be easy to re-skill and rehabilitate entire populations who believed in the “new normals” such as a targeted market, advertisements, growth-projections etc., that are introduced into the culture by by capital-forces; they now feel betrayed by it. The situation is not different from the lottery-ban, smoking-ban or even the taxi-aggregator strikes (Ola and Uber drivers are now agitating) where both the consumer and producer are fed on new addictions that are shown to provide “abundant wealth to all” but in reality provides “short-term and exclusive benefits for few”. In addition to that, it is important to note that the population set to lose their livelihood are the same set of people who are on the “IUCN Red List” (if I may loosely use the term) of climate change. Loss of livelihood is imminent, it is only a matter of how; displacement? disasters? outbreak of diseases? Hence, it is myopic to use the “loss of livelihood” argument to avoid action when our inaction would have the same devastating effects, albeit at a larger scale and a later time.</p>
<p>Instead of finding fault with the Supreme Court order which according to critics should-not or could-not have interfered with the “Indian way of life” we should have looked into society, into ourselves; we should have constantly learnt, tweaked and made necessary changes to our lifestyles for our own growth as well as our civilization’s and that would have been real “development”. Did the Supreme Court intervene and mandate some “devout Hindu families” to start using mp3-recordings or mobile phone apps instead of real priests? Or was it driven by a silent appropriation of technology? Was it lack of priests? Or cost? I have come across “adjustments” made to culture whenever it suits someone. Then why not adopt mp3-recordings of sounds of firecrackers going off? And watch fireworks on a big screen projector instead? Would that be blasphemy? Are firecrackers part of a traditional religious accoutrement?</p>
<p>Recently, the Chief Minister of Kerala, Shri. Pinarayi Vijayan, spoke at length about how past history shows that every time there was social reform, it would be initially marked by irrational behaviour and a violent defense mechanism which opposes change. There were women who jumped into the funeral-pyre despite the ban on “Sati” and women who threw other women into the pyre. There were women who forcefully tore away the upper garment of lower-caste women in Kerala after they were supposedly emancipated from a custom of exposing their breasts. His speech was in relation to the controversy that was raked up by opportunistic political parties a week earlier. We have always been irrational and panicky about change, be it about foregoing a few climate-unfriendly “customs and practices” or about learning to respect the individuality of women. But if we do not change, the climate will, the planet will; and a changing planet takes no prisoners.</p>
