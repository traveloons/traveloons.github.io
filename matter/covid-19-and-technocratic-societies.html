<div class="content mt-5 pt-2"><p>The year was 1909. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was on board the SS Kildonan Castle when he had started working on what was later considered his seminal work, a book named &ldquo;Hind Swaraj&rdquo; (published as &ldquo;Indian Home Rule&rdquo; in English). Making his arguments against modernity and - what he considers - the &ldquo;westernization&rdquo; of India, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Good travels at a snail&rsquo;s pace — it can, therefore, have little to do with the railways. Those who want to do good are not selfish, they are not in a hurry, they know that to impregnate people with good requires a long time. But evil has wings. To build a house takes time. Its destruction takes none. So the railways can become a distributing agency for the evil one only. It may be a debatable matter whether railways spread famines, but it is beyond dispute that they propagate evil.&rdquo;
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, &lsquo;Hind Swaraj&rsquo;, 1909, Page 42</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gandhi used the railways as an example from his times. The idea that the Indian railway was a shining colonial contribution existed, during - and after - Gandhi’s times. So it is not surprising that he chose the same to make a provocative argument in his inimitable style.</p>
<p>Decades later, post-colonial India shed both Gandhi and its socialistic tendencies due to internal and external pressures. Embracing capitalism and merging it with archaic concoctions of exploitative systems, India manifested a modernity of its own. And as far as the speed of travel is concerned, railways are the least of worries. If one were to borrow Gandhi&rsquo;s words, the &ldquo;distributing agency&rdquo; was now a conglomerate/combination of exploitative economics and populist politics.</p>
<p>A little more than a century after &ldquo;Hind Swaraj&rdquo; was written, &ldquo;evil&rdquo; seems to have travelled at lightning speed across the oceans into homes of the rich and poor alike. Covid-19, with no known cure or vaccine was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020; a virus that broke barriers of nation-states, class and race. The unpredictability of the situation and the possible future trajectories leaves the smartest and the wisest of experts silent.</p>
<p>The emergence of Covid-19 would have been easily brushed aside like all other miseries that confront the proletariat of the world if not for the simple fact that this virus seemed to have been very egalitarian in its approach. World over, the leaders, capitalists and the middle-class were affected. This meant attention was immediately diverted from all pressing issues of the day to the Covid-19 by enthusiastic media, journalists and writers who conveniently became pawns at the hand of authoritarian governments who were waiting for such a golden opportunity to implement the &ldquo;iron hand&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Authoritarian populism had to contend with capitalism. So choices had to be made. What was more important? A workforce that will work but will spread diseases and hence might die? Or a workforce that stays at home unproductive and hence will die due to hunger?</p>
<p>Like card-holding capitalists, without having the slightest clue, the responsibility was handed over to the politicians who took their chances. In India this meant that a lockdown was imposed with zero research hours going into aspects of implementation.</p>
<p>Some called it &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo;. A few others who had the privilege of living in large homes or had access to internet, found the term insensitive and called it &ldquo;physical distancing&rdquo;. But in reality it was putting a &ldquo;distance between the precariat-citizens/proletariat and their food&rdquo;. The lockdown - the need for which was justified on the basis of Covid-19 being a communicable disease - however failed to consider the needs of the working poor.</p>
<p>It was just one of those &ldquo;last straws that break the camel&rsquo;s back&rdquo; situation when a country that was already reeling under a bad economy, farmer suicides, unemployment, social unrest, communalism, patriarchy etc. had to now endure this direct threat from a virus as well as the accompanying threat from bad governance and policy making.</p>
<p>So here we are. Weeks into the lockdown. The victims of capitalism during peace-times continue to be the victims of harsh-capitalism during war-times such as this pandemic. Unable to access basic necessities such as food, some try to head home to the solace and warmth of families and known-faces perhaps to die together rather than alone. Some die anyways, unable to reach their hometowns. Some do not know where to go. Hence they look forward to being taken care of by the very perpetrators of this violence - the privileged and the state.</p>
<p>But it is we, both the privileged classes as well as the working poor, who have been told to rest; to cool our heels off; to hang up our boots in some cases. Meanwhile, Capital is working hard, looking for opportunities. &ldquo;Economic activity&rdquo; must go on. Stocks have to somehow rise, there is fossil fuel out there that still needs to be pumped out, there are minerals to be extracted, there is water to be diverted into bottles. Capital cannot afford to rest, especially when everyone has been promised that &ldquo;one fine day&rdquo; things are going to be alright. So capital went to work while we were all in the lockdown.</p>
<p>The city of Bangalore, is considered one of India&rsquo;s crown jewels. Having arrived on the international capital circuits via the IT industry it went from what was a garden-city to becoming a garbage-city. Over two decades of IT and its attendant speculative economy saw the rise of an influential class of Bangaloreans who also changed the socio-politics of the region. This class holds the key to future economic activities (if any) and their appeasement was deemed important by both capital and the state. So irony of ironies, during the lockdown a mobile app based service was launched for delivering &ldquo;essentials&rdquo; to apartments around Bangalore. So while bare essentials are not being delivered to the needy, technology and capital, with help from state machinery, combined to resolve the possible deprivation among the elite.</p>
<p>The pandemic itself is most certainly a result of long term misplaced priorities when it comes to human-nature relationships. And here we were, in modern India in an IT based entrepreneurial world, continuing to prioritize incorrectly, and more so, unethically. The elite class of Bangalore which was already cushioned by their list of privileges did not need further cushioning. The fact that this happened when in the same week, thousands of construction workers and migrants were going hungry was shameful and also very revealing as to what is to be expected from a society that has travelled at high-speed past the ground realities, into newer planes and greener pastures and is cut off completely from the needs of fellow brethren.</p>
<p>The speed with which “evil” travels becomes a secondary issue when speed itself becomes evil. In Bangalore and other urban centers where the elite have access mobile devices, network speeds and the money to recharge them, the same cannot be said of the working class. But the many solutions and facilities that were presented by both community as well as the state itself, involved usage of modern phones and apps which resulted in further divide when apps crashed on older phones, servers clogged and functional needs were not meant. The different speeds at which these layers of the society moved meant they also spoke very different languages. Even well meaning individuals who thought they could help, found it challenging to deal with the realities of workers who travelled with either no-phones or old ones (that had not caught up).</p>
<p>Thereby while it is obvious and tempting to think that the “evil” Covid-19 travelled due to the existence of high speed possibilities, as Gandhi seemed to suggest, it would be better to look at speed itself - and its enabler, the economic and political system - as evil. This means, to address the issues of the working class, we would also have to slow down drastically. Prioritizing for solving the imaginary issues of the elite will only maintain these speed-divides which is the root cause of the evil.</p>
<p>As of now a stark contrast between the desperation that is setting in among the working classes and the boredom that is setting in among the elite is now becoming visible. While the demand for food and basic medical facilities to the thousands of workers stuck in construction sites, factories and urban villages grow, there is growing restiveness among the middle classes and the rich. The ultra-rich meanwhile pass their time on the internet, revealing more of their narcissistic selves.</p>
<p>These Covid-19 lockdown times has truly exposed the great chasms in our society and we have to hope that we can build a bridge from &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; to &ldquo;boredom&rdquo;; contrasts that should not have existed.</p>
