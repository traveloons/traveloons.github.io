<p>Be it, Sachin Tendulkar’s straight drive, a successful heart surgery, a persuasive speech by a politician, a few lines of software code, a synchronized and reliable urban-commute or the diligence with which our plumber installed a wash basin, comparison of things or events commonly-accepted as “non art” to “art” is commonplace. We hear (and utter) the phrase “Oh, that was art!” when a job is exceptionally well executed.</p>
<p>While the inherent message in this comparison speaks a common language across sectors — from aviation to beedi-rolling — the actual frequency of such a praise is quite low. In fact more often than not we are lamenting about the poor quality of work at our workplaces and lives. We spend hours staring at software code that causes a severe headaches; we spend hours trying convince our plumbers about the obviousness of a bad job; we spend time running from pillar to post to get an electronic item fixed. In other words, we do not use the phrase as often as we would have liked to. We find “a bad job done” around us most of the time and also partake in “bad jobs”.</p>
<p>If a common trait is to appraise a “great job” by comparing it to art then we can deduce that “art” is nothing but perfection in “any work done”. Art is therefore the purest form of some “production” where human ingenuity, skill, labour and time come together with natural resources to produce something material of value in its purest, perfect form. Then, why isn’t all work-done work-of-art?</p>
<h2 id="jailed-by-the-self">Jailed by the self</h2>
<p>We often find people packing themselves into well-bounded boxes when faced with the question “What do you do?”. “I am a sales person”, “I am a cricketer”, “I am a software engineer”, “I am a carpenter”, “I am a photographer” or “I am a bird watching expert” Sometimes the descriptions are broader with answers such as “I am with the media”, “I am a techie” or “I am in a government job”. The answers vary in form, size and shape but overall this conversation always starts with an inquisitive person questioning the other’s existence and usefulness and the individual feeling obligated to answer.</p>
<p>The need to answer the question on “what one does” seems to have put a lot of pressure on the individual since the question happens to be an ego-breaker. The pressure to respond is so deep that the answer is precooked mostly, so much so that children from a young age are trained to be “something” so that they answer the question confidently whenever and wherever it comes up. Then there are others who form their own answers (hence identity) to this question slowly but surely in life with the intent of having the right answer always.</p>
<p>Artists are not strangers to the above disease. It is very common to hear someone reply with “I am an artist”. In chronic cases, one puts themselves into smaller boxes and reply with “I am a pencil sketch expert”, “I am a flash-mob dancer” or “I am a pop singer”. While shutting oneself into boxes itself is the macro-problem, the boxes labelled “artist” led to “something essential” taken away from the other boxes when it comes to human potential and productivity and that needs exploration and understanding of how art might have come to be and how it thrives in the modern world.</p>
<h2 id="art-and-the-artist">Art and the Artist</h2>
<p>Was the artist a clearly demarcated identity? Were there always clearly laid down rules on what should and shouldn’t an artist do? Cave art is indicative of some sense of art from our ancient world. The patterns that represent humans, animals and nature with simple strokes achieved with the help of very basic drawing equipment (sometimes sharp objects) can be interpreted as religious, recreational or even art-for-art’s-sake but none of the theories stand on solid ground because the creators have vanished from the face of the earth and can scarcely defend their position.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that what is called “cave art” today was just a desperate pre-language drawing where someone wanted to communicate that “a big toothed creature is coming for us tomorrow, hence start running now”. Then cave “art” or even cave “drawing” as we call it was plain communication, as much as today’s “I need a mobile charger”. Mundane. Plain. Functional.</p>
<p>Post the cave art and we find art in pots, pans, swords and ploughs. The potter, mason, blacksmith and the carpenter were but natural evolution when we moved from the hunter gatherer phase (needing warning messages about lurking sabre-toothed tigers) and settled down with agriculture, infrastructure, families, communities, clans, kingdoms, leaders, lords and kings. With limited natural resources (i.e limited speeds of extraction), doing a “perfect job” was not optional but the necessary nature of work. Terms like “start over” or “throw away” had not populated our vocabularies and the need for a great job (and hence work-of-art) was all but natural. There was no artist. Or better put, “everyone was an artist”.</p>
<p>Then came the ultimate fallacy. A rabbit was pulled out of the hat to suggest that a certain set of human beings can subsist on the aesthetic needs of the common. It is important to note that aesthetics and etiquette are part of what can be called our human development called “civilization and culture” and not primeval. The need to hunt, eat and make love really wasn’t about aesthetics. There was no poetry (visual or verbal) in those actions, but mere need for survival. So at some point we really had to commodify aesthetics deliberately with the help of the social and economic order we were setting up.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how there was always the possibility of “spare money” on the top of the hierarchy for pursuits such as “art” when the functional needs of all (including the artist) can be met by another class down the hierarchy. We needed the producer and the consumer for such a commodification to work and thus the “artist” was born. Art is essential, the artist is not; artist is just another creation of the “Homo economicus”.</p>
<h2 id="the-brain-drain-of-art">The brain-drain-of-art</h2>
<p>When “artist” became a viable identity — a career even — generations of thinking, talented, philosophising, outspoken individuals gravitated towards such an identity. Some with eagerness and some forced due to the survival instincts that resulted from being exposed to a predatory economic system that we chose. This movement should have caused what can only be termed as a brain-drain-of-art.</p>
<p>What was left was a work-force that needed to exist to produce the functional goods, be it the pots and pans or the rockets and bio-fuel. The artist evolved, sometimes in generations within a family and sometimes sporadically. The work-force evolved, passing on skills that was affected by the inherent reductionism and “technicality” demanded by the economic systems, reducing things to “barely working” sometimes. Thus when art ceased to be work, work ceased to be art.</p>
<p>We now end up with artists who think of themselves (and also “thought of”) as disconnected from the rest of the system yet function within our space. Consuming natural resources, using up energy, producing goods, selling, buying, participating and non-participating the artist, just like the human beings in the other boxes continue to live and justify the need for the career just like the justifications raised for thousands of other capital-facilitated careers.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-artist">The true artist</h2>
<p>Like deduced earlier, art did not cease to be essential for human development and nurture. So it would have been disheartening if art vanished entirely into the neatly labelled box called “the artist”. It did not. Instead it took on new shapes and meaning. There were innovators, researchers, philosophers, thinkers and scientists who were part of the so called work-force but kept the spirit alive by ensuring human potential was used the right way and we ended up with the “perfect job”. There are millions of them we know who do not call themselves artists but yet make us say “Oh that was art!” simply because they do a great job.</p>
<p>The true artists can be found in communities and tribes even today, sharpening a tool “just right” so as to protect his children from all kinds of animals including fellow humans. The true artist can be found weaving clothing for us in dying handloom industries in Asia. The true artist can be found even inside the glass-buildings of silicon valley, writing the next best piece of software. The true artist can be found in the plains, creating beds for planting maize and corn for the hungry thousands. But all of the above are far fewer than really needed for us to sit back, relax and rest-assured that a great job would be done. We have been stolen of that pleasure thanks to an old rift.</p>
<h2 id="still-searching-for-perfection-">Still searching for perfection …</h2>
<p>Our lives are now filled with materials, goods and services that are below par. We work or participate mostly in ventures where we ourselves produce work that is below par. While the economic systems that led to this situation is really the culprit and needs its own separate analysis (and potential solutions) we do have some actionable items that do not depend on the economic system.</p>
<p>We could easily stop squeezing ourselves into boxes. All we have to do is to tell ourselves that we do not need a tag on our identity. We can easily stop limiting ourselves by using terms such as “artist” (or for that matter “scientist”, “hip-hop dancer” etc). This takes honesty and introspection. We could easily stop imposing an identity on our children. Even statements about children such as “she can be anything she wants when she grows up. Even a guitar player” is toxic because it seems to imply just another box. Unconditional, unapologetic discard of an identity tag is the need of the hour.</p>
<p>When no one is an artist, the world should slowly embrace the idea of all of us being artists, i.e to use the new meaning of the term, perfectionists. We will do a better job of the task at hand. We will produce goods that last longer. We will find time to participate in all the aspects of human survival and development and not just “a small part” of it (while paying for all else with the mystical matter called money).</p>
<p>All of the above is possible when it slowly-and-surely goes hand in hand with transformation of the unjust and unethical economic system itself. Till then, the leaking washbasin and the wall-hanging by a french artist are strange compatriots in our bathrooms making us laugh at our dichotomous human selves.</p>
