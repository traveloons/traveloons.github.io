<p>While the ardent followers of a given religion — be it Christianity, Islam or more recently Hindusim — convince us that their’s is a better one, while certain others try to provide us with the narrative that there is only one god and a single path to it, while the Gandhis of the world understand and accept the existence of many forms and coax us to be “tolerant” and “live and let live”, while innumerable other conceptions of religion are formed-followed-discarded based on nature, trees, cosmos, sexuality and personality, the religion that exists at the very core of our system and continues to be nurtured day in and day out is that of Capitalism. Like the cockroach — easily ignored by us but strong enough to have outlived the Dinosaur — Capitalism retreats into the dark corners as soon as we throw some light but is a constant presence, eating into our resources while we sleep and continue to underestimate it.</p>
<p>Capitalism is such a well devised plan that we forget how entrenched we are in the system and how entrenched it is in our hearts. Capitalism as a word and concept never occurs to us in a religious/spiritual form. Coming under the realm of economy we seem to be conditioned to think of it as a “logical” (even “scientific”) aspect of human life and never dare to put it along with “traditional sounding” concepts such as religion, spirituality and the like. This is because we fail to acknowledge the design. The designers of capitalism were smart enough to camouflage it in a way that this could go undetected for long enough. They put up a logical-and-objective-seeming facade for this show while the nucleus consists of mere “believers” and as axiomatic as it can get.</p>
<p>This is the reason why society “simply accepts” certain notions without thinking about the internals of them. For e.g the GDP is assumed and expected to rise. We are taught to speak languages built on the grammar of “perpetual growth”. We find no one questioning the logic behind the concept of interest and profit; so much so that basic Mathematics lessons in schools incorporate formulae for simple and compound interest into the syllabus while completely disregarding ethics, morals and values. We are taught to be “clinical” and “transactional” in our approach and see the injustice and tragedy that accumulates as exceptions rather than rules.</p>
<p>But when we accept Capitalism as the world religion it is not complicated to find the parallels; it comes with its own pilgrimage routes for e.g, that passes through most of the western world including Europe and Northern America. Minor pilgrimage centers exists in other parts of the world, on large and small islands where this religion was preached to great success. Where capitalism exists and is “religiously” followed, it is not just that other religions have ceased to exist, it is also that the peoples and tribes who practised them (alternative economies, barter systems for e.g) now don’t exist (or are at mortal risk). Thus the Capitalist inquisition has not only been about wiping out thought, it has also been about wiping out civilizations; that is, the worst “religious atrocity” the world has seen.</p>
<p>The so called “New World”, the United States of America takes great pride in its history of separation of state and religion. And under its leadership, the Western world looks at a few “barbaric” countries in the east where religion and state are mixed up to the point of being one and the same. So we sneer along with America when someone mixes Islam-and-Governance or Buddhism-and-Governance or Hindusim-and-Governance. Now the question is, if religion and state should not be mixed up then why is the American state mixed up with Corporations and Capital? Ever so religiously.</p>
<h2 id="emergence-of-a-neoreligion">Emergence of a Neoreligion</h2>
<p>This is where capitalism really shines. Religion — the opium of the masses — in this logic-form was introduced into the psyche of even the states and countries that never had a taste for it, including far away tribes and communities that never understood words such as “private” or “profit”. By the time realization dawned in certain pockets, one had already submitted to this opium and craved for it all the same. Critique of the collusion of corporations and state does not occur to a person who is high on this opium. Thus capitalism is a neoreligion with followers across the world, books that are religiously followed, temples to be visited at appropriate times in our lives, belief systems that are dogmatically established and contradictions that are debated and defended by loyalists. And due to its numbing effects, whether in America or otherwise, we fail to see the “religious effect” it has on ourselves.</p>
<p>The neoreligion that we have inculcated (and considering its lifespan, that which our existence and even birth depended on) sits comfortably on a pedestal taking an “observer” position while the world debates on issues such as secularism, communalism, fascism and dictatorship. Another entity, popularly established as a counter non-religion which is socialism (almost always confused for its cousin communism) is always used as a punching bag to keep the dominant neoreligion thriving and seemingly purposeful.</p>
<p>The “observing pedestal” thus built stands upon unquestionable tenets such as liberalism, free-speech, individual-enterprise, individuality etc which means insulting the neoreligion amounts to insulting the individual. The opium is so strong that one fails to see by attempting to defend the self, one tends to endorse and entertain exploitative systems. The dog-fight that happens between the so called religious and political systems is left for the people who are the worst impacted by the neoreligion. Thus the observing position is left for capitalists, the immediate temple-keepers, the high priests, the loyal followers and beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The observing pedestal is the “safe zone” since no fight happens here. The discourse is left for countries, people, activists and others to fight out. The rise of fascism in the early 1900s, the rise of communism during the mid 1900s, the left-leaning east of the late 1900s, the democratic majority of the 1900s and 2000s and now the rampant “right leaning” the world post 2000 all the way to today is all but the game we get to watch from this pedestal. We are taught that the temples and observing pedestals and the membership-card obtained from this neoreligion abdicates us from any responsibility of having something to do with the dog-fight, discourse and solutions for the sociopolitical problems that we see amongst us. The opium is strong. And potent.</p>
<p>This neorelgion lets everyone “off the hook” by codifying and dehumanising what essentially are human qualities into mere assertions, statements, numbers and ultimately beliefs. Hence the middle-class, salaried member of the society is completely oblivious to the misery that he/she causes simply by accepting well paid jobs. He/she does not see in themselves perpetrators but only victims. The average town/city dweller does not see the dying farmer as a person but a “failed resource” in a competition with himself/herself. The idea that this whole life is a competitive game to accumulate resources is normalized now for generations who have been born and brought up within the neoreligion.</p>
<h2 id="the-lethal-neoreligion-religion-combo">The lethal Neoreligion-Religion combo</h2>
<p>India these days is a poster-boy for the world that is leaning right. Right wing forces always existed here since the 1900s (while the neoreligion was forming and distracting us with fascism). The right-wing tendencies overtly used the same vocabulary (others, lesser, minority, majority, they, us) and specifically, they ended up making Islam as the logical enemy, Pakistan as the geographical enemy and the Muslim individual as the immediate person to attack. It is key to understand here that had history been different and Jinnah had asked for the exact opposite part of the geography there would still be a right-wing here who thought of Hindus the same way.</p>
<p>India gets a thumbs up of solidarity from many other parts of the world. The surprising yet biggest support came from a country that went on to vote for a person with extreme right-values to lead them. Trump set the benchmark of politics to come when he got elected for the first term. There is an ever present fear of him getting elected again and with the right-wing victory in India post 2019, a second term for Trump does not look far fetched now.</p>
<p>When the world turns right, it is easy to sit on our neoreligious pedestal and look at this world and say it should have “gone left” or “stayed in the center” or whatever the commonly understood graph of sociopolitical systems tell us. But none of that can solve the underlying problem. It is like a debate about whether to hang someone with a red rope or a blue one. We are blinded by our membership-cards (and the perks) when we think of the “right-wing problem” or the “left-wing problem” or the “secular problem” as being an emotional problem (thus religious, sentimental, etc) and we being on the logical side. Capitalism, our neoreligion is itself an emotional problem and getting off the pedestal and addressing it becomes important.</p>
<p>While one way to look at this joyful marriage of Capitalism and Religion in many parts of the world as a result of happy coincidences and even historic, accidental-choices by populace and leaders alike, one is better off accepting this more as a “perfected form” of injustice. It is but the act of all forms of dogma combining and attempting to write new religious holy-books that will further escalate the injustice. It helps if one looks at the problem bottom-up instead of top-down.</p>
<p>Fear, Isolation, Hunger, Alienation, Defeat; all feelable-feelings of a sucidal farmer or an ostracised Muslim in a Hindu dominated village; actual conditions of an underpaid factory worker or an educated and unemployed youth. Gender, demography or ethnicity does not seem to offer a protective shield when the Neoreligion collaborates with traditional religions to setup a new form of world order. That is why a new world should be feared. A perfect world is also perfectly unjust.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-before-we-break-the-camels-back">How long before we break the camel’s back?</h2>
<p>Whether the world moves right or left, we need to think “revolution”. Revolution is not a word that is only to be used in the context of left (or extreme-left or separatist). It is people asking for change because their lives are affected directly. It is basically a set of people who were disenfranchised by the “system” now complaining about it. We need to remember that every ardent centrist, right-winger (or left-winger) is not “the disenfranchised”. Some are just co-opting the causes of others to work towards their own selfish agenda, which is what happens quite often. But nevertheless, a revolution has to be acknowledged and recognised and most importantly the rage “directed”. We have to stare back at the pedestal and prepare ourselves for the ousting of the one-true-religion by this rage.</p>
<p>The neoreligion makes no distinction about its prey — homo-sapiens or otherwise — and hence the complainants themselves need not be humans. The planet itself has been sending out petitions from over a century now and the case has not been up for trial. The human-centric politics that exists today through the entire spectrum from right to left completely ignores these “revolutionaries” who make their voices heard via incessant rains, turbulent waters and walls of dust. It is also very tragic that while we seem to be missing the bus in terms of welfare human beings itself, we will lose the entire planet as we won’t be able to get to the complaints of the other lot.</p>
<p>The neoreligion gets away with its crimes because we allow it to. Just like the Hindu fence-sitters who let go of “one Islamophobic joke to pass across the dinner table” or the Christian gentleman who does not come to the defence of the victim of a racist crime, our sitting on this observer pedestal with the capital-opium in our bloods makes us willing participants in a religious crime. We don’t have to be a right-winger to be a religion-based hater and we don’t get to be a left-winger and wash it off too.</p>
<p>Capitalism makes a seductive appeal through the aforementioned dogmatic qualities but it cannot sustain without us; if we as people who derive energy from food do not see the tragedy in our midst when the food-producer and his family perish as a result; if we as the consumers of electricity and eco-friendly automobiles do not see the coal miner’s helplessness after losing his limbs; if we as writers and thinkers do not see the tears of a surviving husband or sister when bullets take away a loved one who put thoughts into praxis and if we as salaried and developing middle-class make choices that leave nothing to spare for the “choiceless” masses.</p>
<h2 id="the-discomforting-inevitability-of-change">The discomforting inevitability of change</h2>
<p>While in principle and given a fresh clean start, we can find issue with the “right” and “left” there is absolutely no doubt that to counter such a massive shift to the right-politics, with swathes of the populace being misled into finding “others” (instead of the neoreligion), the only way is to counterbalance with the left-way-of-thinking. It is like a sleeping mat that was rolled up and tucked away for long. To flatten it, you need to unroll it and roll it in reverse and hold it there for a few good minutes. Societies and economies are like that sleeping mat and needs the additional help before we equalize. In fact it is not wrong to say that an attempt to flatten it very upfront is going to fail miserably.</p>
<p>Dismantling Capitalism as a system and starting from first-principles while not easy is also going to be unavoidable. It would also be a trap laid for us even if some of us think we can escape the churning that is about to occur if not tomorrow in half a century. It would do good for everyone to partake in this change without ending up as victims or villains. For that we first need to identify our positions and roles in this hierarchy and loosen ourselves from both the shackles. This takes personal effort. But isn’t that possible only if we see how “personal” Capitalism really is?</p>
<p>The keyword here is sacrifice. We cannot even begin to unshackle ourselves without giving up on what we consider “essentials”. At the lower end of middle-class this essentials seem to be in the area of fixed-income, interest-accrual and job-security while at the highest end this can be automobiles and weddings. We have to begin with a true understanding of “essentials”, the common denominator that can reach all, without compromises and sacrifice the rest. Simply appreciating concepts such as degrowth without understanding personal sacrifice will not help. In fact theory without practice will get us nowhere.</p>
<p>Sacrifice involves giving up on concepts such as jobs and wages and appreciating relationships and happiness. It also involves de-skilling and re-skilling. Sacrifice (especially for the generationally privileged) involves appreciating the gentle churn that will occur in our society where the generationally underprivileged will seek to fill the vacuum. It also involves a deliberate pulling out of “capital” from the system by personal disinvestment by liquidating savings, fixed deposits and such and investing in people, agriculture etc. Like mentioned earlier, none of these are easy but all of these are essential and need to happen to the self; and hence the society.</p>
<p>It is only after this “personal correction” that we really can move towards collective rebuilding where we disregard the private and embrace the commons. The commons does not only involve roads, forests, water-bodies and nature. It also involves knowledge, parents, children and humanity. The aforementioned personal sacrifices will naturally lead to the “individual” and proprietorship vanishing and thus the need for personal accumulation and inheritance to not exist.</p>
<p>The aforementioned changes will lead to doubts and questions but that is all but natural. Capitalism was not established in a day and hence will not be dismantled overnight. But facing and answering these questions is a predicament we have right now. This is because, with or without us, the temples of this neoreligion will be destroyed one day and people will see the true enemy and get rid of it. So an early understanding of our own individual roles in this injustice helps us deal with it. The drug needs to be drained out of our blood and there will be withdrawal symptoms. It is good to have time on our hands to deal with that.</p>
<p>Just like conventional religion-switching, switching over from Capitalism and converting to a new one can give one a high. It can also mean a lot of trouble; it is after all a religion. The apologists will ridicule you, the loyalists will try to bully you and the experts will write a death sentence for you. None of us know what a perfect religion looks like, let alone a perfect world. But all of us know what an unkind, unjust and exploitative world looks like. It looks like the one we live in right now. We only have to wake up to see that.</p>
