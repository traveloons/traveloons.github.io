<div class="content mt-5 pt-2"><p>Anyone aware of the political scene in India in 2018, cannot but miss the ongoing race towards the general elections in 2019. The race officially kicked off a few months ago with the incumbent contenders from the Bharatiya Janata Party showcasing last minute populism via their hurried and people-friendly movies towards additional-leniency for items under GST and the Indian National Congress showing they too “cared” with tokenism that put women and women’s issues on the forefront. Also, being a multi-party democracy, as expected, many small and regional parties also “joined the party” and contributed to the noise.</p>
<p>From this cacophonous spectrum was extracted a lone frequency called “let us call out Narendra Modi”. The largest opposition party we have today — the Indian National Congress — which can bring about a mandate (if it plays the cards right) seems to lead in the department of the aforementioned frequency-isolation. Since this “big brother party” was doing it (and so was it’s mascot), the the smaller and regional ones imitated the same. Then it was the turn of activists, writers, artists and intellectuals joining the chorus of “let us hate Narendra Modi” sometimes wantonly, sometimes in haste and mostly due to lack of imagination. Many of us are guilty of endorsing (both online and offline) personal jibes at India’s Prime Minister; his abilities (or the lack of it); his personality (or the lack of it).</p>
<p>Problem is that, while audible and lucid, this singled-out frequency is not going to help anyone’s cause. If a clear mandate needs to be arrived at by the citizens of India in 2019; if such desire exists in the opposition and intelligentsia today; if we really need just and fair results based on what we really desire for our country, we need to evolve and rise up beyond the current modus operandi. The protagonist of this story who was catapulted to notoriety, which later led to fame and then a cult personality is after all but a messenger. All of us should be sensible enough to understand that the old adage of “don’t shoot the messenger” isn’t just to be used for those harmless messengers who run into the maharaja’s court with bad news and later end up as target practice. Messengers come in various shapes, formats and flavors; sometimes wrapped in silver foil and sometimes in sheep’s clothing; messengers of religious dogmas, messengers of hateful ideologies. The old adage applies to all kinds of messengers.</p>
<p>By publicly humiliating and by burning the aforesaid messenger on the social-media-stake we are not going to win or even make a dent, instead we will allow for the true source of the evil to maneuver itself around all of this misplaced attention and emerge victorious. Actually one cannot predict victory for sure, but we can be certain that this maneuvering will happen, which means that we will end up missing our real target, losing focus and will be left barking at puppet-shadows long after the thieves have stowed away their booty.</p>
<p>We all know very well what happens when a frenzy of activity kicks off against a proposed enemy; how people time and again have a need to abdicate themselves of all responsibility and accountability to hold “someone else” as the reason for the rot in society. Think about what happened when “corruption” was made the villain. To be fair “corruption” is indeed a good enemy to have but we need to qualify it as an “enemy within”. People had to look inward when such a movement started about five years ago. But instead everyone associated “the other person” with corruption and conveniently found “faces of corruption” which soon lead to expulsion of those faces. What was left was a void; one that was filled by a product manufactured just for this purpose.</p>
<p>Five years later, if “intolerance” is our enemy, we need to urge ourselves and others around us to “look within” for signs of intolerance. If “hindutva” is our enemy today we need to introspect on our belief systems and that of our family members. If “casteism” is our enemy then we need to look at our surnames and sometimes discard them. If we repeat the act of “putting a face” — of Narendra Modi’s — and expend our voice, energy and action against the same, we will win against that face but not against intolerance, hindutva, casteism, sexism, or any other manifestations-of-the-same-evil that surrounds us.</p>
<p>Our synergy should be for ridding ourselves of the evils first and of those around us. We need to remind ourselves that behind every facebook or twitter account that spews hate on the Internet is a father, brother, mother, sister or a friend who seems like the “good old person you know” but needs listening to and sometimes debating. Our synergy should be to build a better ourselves and then better collectives and communities. If we choose to quickly maneuver ourselves out of this guilt and find the enemy in a face then rest assured that the BJP will simply take out Modi and put another face in his place. But the messages would remain, its true sources will continue to be well-fed and nourished by us, as it has been for the many years after we desired to be a country to lead in ways of democracy and secularism in this part of the planet.</p>
<p>Elections should neither be for “finding faults and replacing one with another” nor should it be for “giving someone a chance”. When we nod our heads in agreement to such arguments we are accomplices in a crime against ourselves (the beneficiaries of an electoral democracy). The general elections of 2019 should be about credibilities of who best represents the people and what this said person has done for the social, economical, environmental, cultural and ethical progress of our country. We are not “de-electing for the past” but we are “electing for the future”. The removal of someone from a position of power has to be seen as the natural side effect of choosing another.</p>
<p>The one in power, the messenger is but merely “our face”. Shooting him down is a futile attempt as we will be the ones dodging the bullets and let me remind again that we as a populace are very good at finding zero-faults with ourselves. We will triumph however, if we were to illegitimize the message itself because a message of togetherness, unity, love, respect, co-operation, dignity does not need a manufactured product or a face. It only needs all of us, you and me working together, to transform ourselves and the societies we live in.</p>
