<div class="content mt-5 pt-2"><p>A pregnant elephant drowned in the river after being fatally injured by
explosive laden fruits. As cruel as this may seem, eliciting the right amount
of anger from a majority of people, this is not a stray incident. There have
been innumerable cases of human-animal conflict in recent past. This comes as
no surprise. With the forests getting cleared at an astonishing pace, with animals
driven to nearby farm lands in search of food, with elephant corridors fragmented,
we can only expect more such unfortunate deaths of innocents. With development
projects getting clearence at an alarming rate, with the Governments paying
scant regard to natural resources and conservation, we are staring at an imminent
danger of wiping out species, causing extreme conflict, loss of lives and livelihoods.</p>
<p>In times such as these, when we are struggling to cope with zoonotical diseases like
Covid-19, with climate emergency at our doorstep, threatening to endanger not just
our forests and wildlife, but our own future generations, we cannot continue with
&ldquo;business-as-usual&rdquo; attitude towards developmental projects. New challenges and
new situations require new strategies to cope. At such a juncture, pushing for a
railway line through primary forests of the Western Ghats should be least of our
priorities. However, the politicians and policy makers think otherwise. The controversial
Hubli Ankola Railway line has yet again come into the limelight with local political
leaders of Karnataka pushing for its implementation with brute force.</p>
<p>This proposed railway line, 169 kms long, cuts through four important biodiversity hotspots -
The Bedthi Conservation Reserve, the Dandeli Hornbill Conservation Reserve, Kali Tiger
Reserve and the Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve. It crossed crucial elephant corridors as well. It
would result in cutting down a whopping 2,47,554 trees and destruction of about 600 hectares
of prime forest land. The forest is home to 256 species of birds, 29 species of mammals,
33 species of frogs and 50 species of butterflies, some of which are endemic and critically
endangered. Last year, according to the statistics, the number of animal deaths (accounted) stood at
12,625, of with train accidents alone accounting for 3,479 animals. This means, in the last
three years, everyday 31 animals died on the tracks. With a train running through
such a rich biodiversity hotspot can be catastrophic. These forests are our last
remaining refuge. The trees that are identified for cutting currently sequester
2,25,215 tonnes of carbon, which is equivalent to the carbon emmission of 1,61,847 cars per year!</p>
<p>The method of approval for this project has also come under scrutiny due to its
suspicious proceedings, flouting the rules of Karnataka State Wildlife Board.
The wildlife board met on 9th Mar, 2020 and had decided to drop this proposal,
considering the destruction of rich biodiverse forests and also the fact that there
were alternative routes available connecting Hubli and Ankola (A railway line which is
just 55 Kms longer already connects Hubli and Ankola. A national highway and a state highway
also connect these two places and are already underutilized). However, without sufficient
notice, the Board was again called for a meeting on 20th Mar, 2020, with a majority of
members absent and three new special invitees, all politicians who are not concerned with
the Wildlife Board. Owing to political pressure from these political leaders, the Chief
Minister, who is the Chairman of the Board approved the project, reversing his previous
decision made just a few days ago. This came as a shock to the Board members as well as
experts and environmentalists.</p>
<p>Environmentalists and experts have been speaking about this project, opposing it
unanimously from the start. This movement which was earlier limited to environmental
groups has now spread widely, thanks to their efforts through social media, and is
making an effort to reach out to the larger population. Through its awareness campaigns,
various wildlife and environmental groups are soliciting public support against this
project. There are also local citizen groups in Hubli / Dharwad that are opposing it. Their
efforts are directed towards highlighting the bio-diversity loss, the increasing human-
animal conflict and the impact on local population living in these areas. The project
which is touted for the &ldquo;Development of North Karnataka&rdquo; region is nothing but an empty
promise. It would result in vast destruction of the region and loss of livelihood to
locals, who now depend of these forest produce. It would worsen the drought situation
that is already prevalent in this region and result in landslides and floods during rains.
The effects of such a project will be amplified in coming years marring the communities
for generations.</p>
