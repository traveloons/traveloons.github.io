<p>The Indian Legislature recently passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) in the Lok Sabha. This Act facilitates citizenship for Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi and Jain minorities fleeing from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Act is considered the first time where religion has been overtly been made a condition for Indian citizenship.</p>
<p>Despite all the makings of a disaster, the fascism-inspired, self proclaimed Hindu-partisan BJP ensured that the Bill was passed with least amount of preparations or consultations, both with the public as well as the opposition. The result was that Bill which had vociferous critique even during the early days of its consideration, resulted in massive protests as soon as it was deemed an Act. The protests continue today.</p>
<h2 id="the-manufactured-binary">The manufactured binary</h2>
<p>Most of Indian media which has been a pliant and willing partner in the transformation of India into a hyper-nationalist state was quick to try and “un-news” the protests in an attempt to render the protests ineffective. The initial wave of protests were thus shoved under the carpet of mass-ignorance and things were seemingly going as per plan for the government. But then things changed and the Indian citizen took notice.</p>
<p>Since the aforementioned “denial tactic” did not work, the the entire machinery has now settled on a new plan. With a careful choice of language, words and a conspiring-tone; with rhetoric dressed up as actual questions the news-readers ask “if the protests were peaceful” and the celebrities “call for peaceful forms of dissent”. Elsewhere the writers write “about the history of non-violence” and the singers claim that songs are “by default non-violent means of protest”.</p>
<p>Peaceful vs Aggressive; Violent vs Non-violent. The black and the white; the heroes and the villains. The good and the bad. We are expected to quickly side with one of the factions. There is extreme danger if we were to agree to this new demand of showing our loyalty to these imaginary groups.</p>
<p>For the BJP/RSS supporter and the politician it is “violent” as long as he/she can hold anyone in the opposition responsible for it and turn this around politically in their favour. “Violence” can be called by any name as long as “blame” can be attached to someone the BJP can maneuver around this “mild annoyance”. For the others who are actively engaged with the issue, the phrase “violent protest” conjures up a lot of imagery; that of burning buses, stones on the street, bloodied human beings and overall chaos and “lawlessness”. On the other hand, “non-violent protests” conjures up smiling or placid faces with placards and candles.</p>
<p>For yet others who form the mass of the population, the phrase “violent protest” has an entirely different meaning (which is more than imagery, it is life). Any protest means things like “affected livelihood” and “disrupted transport” (which in turn affects livelihood). It means lost wages, vindictive bosses or even unemployment. A certified-violent protest in their surrounding (with or without their participation) means all of the aforementioned concerns get amplified.</p>
<p>Hence collectively we tend to respond to it. Which is why we have some opposition leaders immediately responding to the allegation by explicitly calling “for peaceful protests” to their followers. Which is why some protesters going an extra mile to “declare peaceful protests”. Which is why there is the classic “you folks are peaceful, but what if anti-social elements inside you start something?” dog-whistle being used by supporters.</p>
<h2 id="violence-unseen-unheard-unfelt">Violence, unseen, unheard, unfelt</h2>
<p>The core idea behind this manufactured binary is to create an imaginary division of violence and non-violence in protests and thereby create two kinds of protesters so that we can suck up the “deemed non-violent” ones quickly into the “good side” and/or render their cause irrelevant. On the other hand, this tactic is a calculated move to coerce us into branding everyone who has an opinion into the “violent” class by exploiting our understanding of violence. Hence to avoid being herded as sheep, we need to attempt to understand violence itself.</p>
<p>To begin, let us ask ourselves a few questions. Is Violence all about blood, burning buses, weapons and people-running and crowd control on the streets? Is it violent only if we see it on our TV screens or see pictures in newspapers? Is it violence only if we read about it? Is it violent only when people are face-to-face and not otherwise? On the contrary, Are water cannons non-violent? What about injuries that do not involve bloodshed? What about sweet smelling poisonous gases?</p>
<p>Violence clearly exists without all its conventional aesthetics around us, in many forms. We either fail to recognize it or got conditioned to ignore it. Our life-force, food is a result of violence; choose any diet but it is true that some amount of violence is involved for us to accumulate energy via food. Capitalism in all forms and versions as implemented on this planet, in which we partake and contribute is violent and exploitative. We don’t see the violence in helpless and the hungry night after night trying to sleep on an empty stomach while staring at huge advertisements with images of food on the opposite end of the street. We do not consider it violent when sisters quietly shed a tear when their brothers are chosen to be sent to school. We don’t see the violence in the competition setup for us in schools and workplaces. The violence involved in making something “cheap” for us to consume is written-off.</p>
<p>Further, we don’t see the violence in our own behavior when it comes to tribalisms such as casteism, regionalism and communalism when we constantly remind others that they “are others”. We do not see the violence in the assumed hierarchies within our families. The violence of just having pets at home (and hence control) or domestication of wild animals is turned around on its head and called compassion by us. We certainly do not consider the amount of pollution (noise, air) we put out there, thus affecting other creatures, as violence.</p>
<p>The aforementioned cases of violence are not (always) necessarily with bloodshed. Hence these instances of violence where we are both the victims and perpetrators do not seem to get an appropriate response (let alone action) from us. The cumulative effect of this violence is far more than what is currently being “hinted” by the proponents of the binary.</p>
<p>Think about it. What is the value of a “burning bus” compared to lives of people who are going to be at peril thanks to an unethical and immoral law? What is the value of “public property” (which is nothing but “capital belonging to the state”) in comparison to thousands of lives that might perish in future or the energetic youth that is dying today? Is taking a life by shooting at the protesters because they “destroyed public” property a non-violent reaction? Is it justified, considering one is “mere matter” and another is a human life?</p>
<h2 id="need-to-own-up-the-conflict">Need to own up the conflict</h2>
<p>If we make an attempt to understand violence in all its forms we will start to appreciate the fact that there is no reason to take sides in the ongoing protest. The questions that we must ask and/or the choose to answer are : Were the protests “effective”? Were the protests “audible”? Were the protests “justified”? Were the protests “passionate”? Were the protests “honest”?. There are probably other ways too to assess these protests rather than the of violence/non-violence.</p>
<p>However it is not new for such binaries to come up. During the Indian Independence struggle, the movement split into extremists and moderates with so many further splits and joins. In theory the moderates can be defined as people who believed in petitioning, deliberations etc and the extremists in strikes, agitation and boycott. It is not impossible to see the parallels we have today. But the curiosity here is that Gokhale who considered himself moderate, for a long time considered Gandhi’s “picketing method” as an unnecessarily confrontational tactic. Meanwhile Gandhi himself was busy talking about his method (the “Satyaagraha”) as a non-violent (and hence presumably moderate) method. History shows us that many a times the moderates thought Gandhi was too extremist and the extremists thought that Gandhi was being too moderate.</p>
<p>There is always going to be the Gandhi-Gokhale moment (so to speak) between all of us where someone’s righteous protest seems violent to us and our righteous protest seems violent to a third person. The existence of this Gandhi-Gokhale conflict indicates that our perception of violence is nothing but personal, i.e my “violence” begins where my personal “comfort zone” ends.</p>
<p>This is why so many among us even now consider it easy to sit back and watch where the BJP/RSS are taking us and try to reason that our own acts are non-violent. But the truth is that both in our action as well as inaction we hurt someone, somewhere. To ensure that does not happen, we need to ensure we don’t let go of the Gandhis, Gokhales and the desirable conflict. What the current powers will try to do is stretch this conflict to a point where we will be unable to see eye to eye. They have done it in the name of religion, they will do it again in the name of this new binary which is being played up.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let us not participate in this political and media trial of whether the ongoing protests are violent or non-violent. Is anyone convinced that many would have read the news if not for a few burnt buses? Does anyone believe that the mostly Whatsapp-educated society of today would even have heard about dissenting compatriots if not for the pictures of beaten up students (even if posted with the intent of vilifying them). Also, if we can claim there are a few today who have snapped out of the 2014 hypnosis, would that have been possible without this slight disturbance?</p>
<p>There are 200 million lives at stake at this point thanks to the CAA. We should decide whether we value those human lives more than material comforts around us, be it private or public. Even the whole reasoning that “it is not just the 200 million but what comes after it, i.e the Christians, Dalits etc” is an unnecessary argument. If the proposed Citizenship Amendment Act would put “even 1 life at stake” India should-and-will oppose it.</p>
