      <description>Introduction Some consider climate change as the beginning of the end; some say it is the end stage of Capitalism. It could be both since there is a distinct possibility that humanity will end, knowing nothing but Capitalism in all its seductive, mutated future-forms. Regardless of how we perceive these sequence of events or whether we consider these issues as economic, social or political, our immediate action has tremendous bearing on our future.</description>

      <description>Establishing unquestionability While the ardent followers of a given religion — be it Christianity, Islam or more recently Hindusim — convince us that their’s is a better one, while certain others try to provide us with the narrative that there is only one god and a single path to it, while the Gandhis of the world understand and accept the existence of many forms and coax us to be “tolerant” and “live and let live”, while innumerable other conceptions of religion are formed-followed-discarded based on nature, trees, cosmos, sexuality and personality, the religion that exists at the very core of our system and continues to be nurtured day in and day out is that of Capitalism.</description>

      <description>Introduction Imagine an accident; say a person slips into a crevice during an expedition to the cold and dangerous mountains. When he/she cannot be rescued within a few hours, we pray that they “somehow return”. When we don’t hear from them for an entire day, we pray that they “return in one piece”. When after a week of waiting and praying, they do return, with an arm and leg missing, we clap, cheer and stand around them.</description>

      <description>Perhaps the “human story” is the greatest story ever told; a story that has the entire known universe for its canvas and a superlative species as the protagonist. Problem is, it has always been preaching to the choir and is akin to any other hagiography. It is a story that will always be told to children to inculcate pride and one that the delusional return to when there is a need to “chew the cud” to avoid facing current realities.</description>

      <description>Inherited Misnomers Of course, we did once enjoy the thrill that came with an escapade with our cousin, only to rat on her later at the dining table or feign ignorance when she got thrashed by her parents, while our eyes met for a fraction of a second. Of course. We do remember how we felt when our parents found us a seat in the plushest college in the city while the person whom we called “best friend” had to find work after school.</description>
