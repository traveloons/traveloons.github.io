      <description>Understanding war The topic of India and Pakistan has always conjured up various emotions and reactions in people. The old and the young, the Indian and the Pakistani, the citizen and the observer. The reactions range from a request to change the topic to a rabid speech on the “arch enemy”. Children in India identify Pakistan as a “villain” (like from their movies or video games) very early in childhood. One should not be surprised if a few of them believe it is the Pakistanis that we (Indians) valiantly “fought” in 1947 in a “war for Independence”, to become what is known as India today.</description>
