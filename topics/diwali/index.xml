      <description>Deepavali, the festival of pollution is round the corner. The narrative, dialogue and overall theatrics around firecrackers have never changed over the last three decades. The tabloids masquerading as newspapers usually start the year’s common-minimum on this topic with the “harmful effects of firecrackers” on one page while allowing for adverts to run subtly on another. There will be awareness campaigns started by individuals or concerned groups and collectives. The family get-togethers and dinners will have the firecracker topic as the chief-guest.</description>
