      <description>Something is amiss A phrase that has come to be accepted and understood and also shares space, stage and sometimes even the podium with “climate change” is that of “climate justice”. While it has taken aeons to message and articulate this phrase and bring about understanding and even consensus around it by inserting it into scholarly and mainstream articles, most have either failed to understand it in its entirety or claimed to have grasped it, having done so only partially.</description>

      <description>Understanding war The topic of India and Pakistan has always conjured up various emotions and reactions in people. The old and the young, the Indian and the Pakistani, the citizen and the observer. The reactions range from a request to change the topic to a rabid speech on the “arch enemy”. Children in India identify Pakistan as a “villain” (like from their movies or video games) very early in childhood. One should not be surprised if a few of them believe it is the Pakistanis that we (Indians) valiantly “fought” in 1947 in a “war for Independence”, to become what is known as India today.</description>

      <description>Deepavali, the festival of pollution is round the corner. The narrative, dialogue and overall theatrics around firecrackers have never changed over the last three decades. The tabloids masquerading as newspapers usually start the year’s common-minimum on this topic with the “harmful effects of firecrackers” on one page while allowing for adverts to run subtly on another. There will be awareness campaigns started by individuals or concerned groups and collectives. The family get-togethers and dinners will have the firecracker topic as the chief-guest.</description>

      <description>Introduction Imagine an accident; say a person slips into a crevice during an expedition to the cold and dangerous mountains. When he/she cannot be rescued within a few hours, we pray that they “somehow return”. When we don’t hear from them for an entire day, we pray that they “return in one piece”. When after a week of waiting and praying, they do return, with an arm and leg missing, we clap, cheer and stand around them.</description>

      <description>Perhaps the “human story” is the greatest story ever told; a story that has the entire known universe for its canvas and a superlative species as the protagonist. Problem is, it has always been preaching to the choir and is akin to any other hagiography. It is a story that will always be told to children to inculcate pride and one that the delusional return to when there is a need to “chew the cud” to avoid facing current realities.</description>
