      <description>In the not-so-recent past During the sunset-years of the 19th century, a radical thought was taking shape in India. The &amp;ldquo;Swadeshi Movement&amp;rdquo; which was officially launched in 1905 had its theoretical aspects defined in the late 1800s. Stalwarts such as Naoroji, Tilak, Ghokale, Aurobindo are credited with the thought leadership for the same. History tells us that the Swadeshi movement is a &amp;ldquo;nationalistic movement&amp;rdquo;, i.e a political movement. But at its very core, this movement was an economical one, born from the understanding that the oppression of the Indians within India was predicated upon the economic control of the entire Indian populace by a few Englishmen.</description>
