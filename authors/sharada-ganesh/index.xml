      <description>It was 2 a.m. I was woken up from my sleep by a numbing cold that crept up my left leg. I shivered despite the layers of warmth provided by my sleeping bag and my thermals.

      <description>I sit down to work; My thoughts roam astray. I don’t seem to recollect what I set out to do. The work piles up; it is way past the deadlines. I keep making excuses; I keep extending the timeline. A proper estimate is impossible to give because I don’t know for sure how long this will go on. I am disturbed. I push myself to sit down and write a few lines at least.</description>
