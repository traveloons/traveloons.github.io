      <description>It was 2 a.m. I was woken up from my sleep by a numbing cold that crept up my left leg. I shivered despite the layers of warmth provided by my sleeping bag and my thermals. The air was still. Frost had formed on top of our tent. I turned to my side with great discomfort and tried to close my eyes to go back to sleep again. But the cold kept reminding me of the long night; the several hours of darkness and gloom before the sun would appear.</description>

      <description>A pregnant elephant drowned in the river after being fatally injured by explosive laden fruits. As cruel as this may seem, eliciting the right amount of anger from a majority of people, this is not a stray incident. There have been innumerable cases of human-animal conflict in recent past. This comes as no surprise. With the forests getting cleared at an astonishing pace, with animals driven to nearby farm lands in search of food, with elephant corridors fragmented, we can only expect more such unfortunate deaths of innocents.</description>

      <description>I sit down to work; My thoughts roam astray. I don’t seem to recollect what I set out to do. The work piles up; it is way past the deadlines. I keep making excuses; I keep extending the timeline. A proper estimate is impossible to give because I don’t know for sure how long this will go on. I am disturbed. I push myself to sit down and write a few lines at least.</description>
