<p>The topic of India and Pakistan has always conjured up various emotions and reactions in people. The old and the young, the Indian and the Pakistani, the citizen and the observer. The reactions range from a request to change the topic to a rabid speech on the “arch enemy”. Children in India identify Pakistan as a “villain” (like from their movies or video games) very early in childhood. One should not be surprised if a few of them believe it is the Pakistanis that we (Indians) valiantly “fought” in 1947 in a “war for Independence”, to become what is known as India today. While the above seems like hyperbole to you (and me), in a post-fake-news-world any kind of “truth” can take root in public imagination.</p>
<p>The two countries are almost at war today. Being countries that possess weapons that (if used) could send the entire subcontinent back to the stone age, it becomes important to discuss war. To say that the countries are “almost at war” is to presuppose that war happens with well defined schedules that have start-and-end dates. One might choose to use history for validating the argument and find that wars have start and end dates. So it is tempting to think that a future (potential) war comes with its own plan, start-date and adequate warning.</p>
<p>But it would be naive of us to look at war from that point of view. That is the political point of view; also the historians point of view. It is the result of looking-back at what transpired. To understand war we would have to understand violence and injustice, and accept that both of these concepts are realities of life for the majority of us at the very bottom of a hierarchy; even without what is conventionally called “a war”.</p>
<p>In a crude yet scientific sense, war is the imposition of human power against the organic, natural evolution of life itself. It is the “big” attempt to put ourselves in our creator’s position from where we intend to orchestrate the (otherwise) entropy that defines all organisms on this planet. War is when all efforts have failed in negotiation to live as one with this planet.</p>
<p>The power that the word “war” brings to the vocabulary is the reason why it is used to talk about “final solutions” to many problems. The “war against drugs”, “war against piracy” and even the “war against racism” are but examples of how the word “war” is used when all other “actionable” appendages have failed to describe what we feel like saying. It is not a coincidence that the choice of words start at “awareness”, then passing through words like “regulation”, “control”, “ban” etc. and ends up at “war”. When the word “war” is not used in a context such as drugs, piracy or pornography the word seems to gain (rather than lose) potency and finally comes to represent just one thing. Destruction.</p>
<p>While “war” is the “declaration of an intent”, “violence” is the method that we have to adopt to start and keep a war going. We have to destroy “units of life” with violence when we “go to war”. These units of life can even be extremely small (like cells in our body) that “disengage” or “dissent” (like in cancer) which we obliterate using weapons-like-medicine (as in allopathy). But note that while war needs violence, violence does not need war. Violence can be perceived even without a “declaration of war” under circumstances that don’t seem “war like”.</p>
<p>There is violence in the smallest of injustices that is meted out on our fellow creatures. Acts that we take for granted — including our need to survive by eating — includes violence of various degrees. Violence exists in the smallest unit (the self) to the largest possible political groupings (countries). Violence fills all the other sub-spaces in between. Thus, for the one at the receiving end of this violence, “declaration of war” is a moot point. Questions such as “should we have a war?” or “will there really be a war?” are pointless when fighting an eternal one.</p>
<p>The fact that war needs violence makes it easier for us to embrace violence freely, tactfully and discreetly. It helps us collate the violence from “before” and “after” into a “point in time” (the war) and also hand over the moral responsibility of the same to a third-party-entity. We get to do this while continuing to feel at ease and being able to forgive ourselves. After all, to “forgive ourselves” is what we really want isn’t it? To go to bed at night, pleased with ourselves that “even if we did not participate”, “atleast nothing bad came out of us”. The desire to be a good human being is desirable. But we should not be trying to achieve such a goal by outsourcing our moral values, action and accountability to someone else (in many cases “the state”). Because, then we fail.</p>
<p>We need to understand that countries are made up of people and people are responsible for what ethics and values the country upholds. If there were to be an ill person, we say the “person is ill”. If another person is a great football player we say “he is a great football player” not that he has a great leg or powerful muscles (while such details matter, they are secondary). Just like the human body, the country is but a summation of its citizens. War thus becomes our own making. India and Pakistan are not at war, it is we who are at war. The contradiction can be understood when we start uttering the words “I am at war”.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-war">Cost of war</h2>
<p>War has never lead to any satisfaction, let alone victory. If there is anything at all, it would be to say, war has left a few people wealthy. They are the few who have been in one way or their other “investors” in the war i.e in the market of buying and selling weapons. However, one does not need to be at the uppermost layers of such an industry to be called a beneficiary of war. We can be outsourced by such companies,we can be co-opted by them. We can have money in banks which loan out to such companies. We could have taken loans from entities that have side-businesses dealing with weapons. We can have money in mutual funds that lent to such companies. We can be activists, social enterprises and NGOs that receive donations from people who made money in all the aforementioned ways. Sadly, we only have to actively or passively interact with the neoliberal system for being beneficiaries of war at various degrees.</p>
<p>But if the above is true, then shouldn’t everyone be happy with a war? Why are the stories about past wars all about pain, destruction and even regret? Why is there an active opposition to war itself? The reason is that the fallacy that keeps neo-liberalism alive does not fly in the face of an actual war. The entities that are at the bottom of the hierarchy in our economic system, suffer the most when it comes to a war. While their suffering gets suitable cover-up (and build up of hope) when it comes to a debate on economic systems, do not get any such defense during war. During war, the weak and marginalized are not promised “competitive fields” or “merit based rewards”. During wars, it is complete destruction of the weak, without any pretext and apologies. Thus we lose nature, natural resources, animals, women, minorities etc. in that order.</p>
<p>So to measure the cost of war in terms of money alone is just to work oneself into an infinite loop between war and our chosen economic system. To think differently about war and its consequences, one has to step out and analyse war without the basis of exchange values (what was lost/destroyed, how much was it worth), but instead look at the use-values. Friendship for example has tremendous use-value. We all have an episode from life where the existence of a friend was “worth more” than all our assets put together. We have been through times when only friendship worked in our favour when a transactional or even a blood-relationship failed to work. Talking about relationship itself, we have also realised how a “real relationship” (common ideas, thoughts and ideologies) has worked for us in a situation where a “business relationship” failed. Also, we have felt “trust” has worked for us many a times, trumping legal concepts such as “securities” and “guarantees”. And finally we have also experienced the “good” that has been always returned to us which we gave away when the “money” might not have returned.</p>
<p>The loss of the above (and many more) use-values are the real cost of going to war, i.e when we resort to violence, denying the possibility of any kind negotiation, compromise or adjustment. We are essentially saying “I don’t believe in a win-win situation” and proceeding to eliminate all the arguments from the other side by eliminating matter/material itself. But while the cost of that matter/material is measurable in money, the loss of the non-material i.e friendship, relationship and trust are the real casualty.</p>
<p>Both the material and the non-material cannot be rebuilt. While we are told stories of such reconstructions (“an entire city rises from ashes”) we need to realize that this is based on additional material extraction from the planet (a job redone) and sometimes with the establishment of newer forms of injustice. But even if were to be delusional about material reconstruction, we seem to ignore that the non-material can never be rebuilt. As individuals, when we “move through time”, every next-minute we are writing down a story of this world up until the previous-minute. Since time itself is non-linear only in the movies, everything that we do (or did) remains an integral part of the story. One could agree with statements such as (“peace can be established after war”) only if we all really had the capability to forget and forgive unconditionally.</p>
<p>History has shown us that times-of-peace are just preparatory-periods for the next war. Generations spend these periods in resentment and teaching their children and grandchildren about past injustice and scarring them for life. So just like vaccinations, prevention is the only cure. The cost of war, thus can remain a “cost” only if we can pay it back and settle. But it is not so. It is a cost that is as non-material as the values it destroys. And hence never paid back (or demanded) post the event. Instead, it is paid upfront in humanity and moral capital. Why would we want to pay it upfront? And why would we want to pay it with our own selves?</p>
<h2 id="war-and-the-non-humans">War and the non-humans</h2>
<p>War itself is dehumanising and leads to a loss of humanity as described earlier. So technically the participant in a war is not really human. But if we were to keep that aside and look at “human” as in “homo sapien”, the choice of going to war (or to remain in war) leads to speciesism. This is because the arena for the war as well as the victims are not only of the same species. Even if (for argument sake) the war is towards justifiable causes (“was attacked first”, “cleaning up the system”) what does nature and its non-human inhabitants such as the trees, birds, bees, insects, mammals and fishes have to do with geopolitics?</p>
<p>Wars have changed the topography of places and brought about destruction of ecosystems at large scale. Wars have contributed to the clearance of habitats of various creatures and resulted in vulnerabilities and extinctions. Wars have even caused pain to creatures within the “domestic” (read that as human-centric-and-economic) sphere such as cows, horses, cats, dogs. Wars have changed the course of rivers and streams that in turn contribute to the life-cycle. Finally, wars have depleted the earth of natural resources (oil, minerals etc.) that under non-war conditions would have contributed to human material development.</p>
<p>The damage to the ecosystem and the annihilation of biodiversity means that wars are active contributors to the changing climate, a problem the entire world is trying to tackle. A post-war world cannot afford the time and energy towards a climate-change cause when a pre-war world does not. Also, irreparable damage caused to the planet will only mean further degrading living conditions which is ironically a “desirable status” for the war-mongering politicians because it would mean “good reason” to keep an “external enemy” alive thus causing future wars. One can see the contradiction in being able to forecast a future war if a current war was “to end all problems”.</p>
<p>Since we do not have the means (or intent) to “empower” the non-humans to be able to participate in a war/no-war debate and since we do not entertain participation from non-humans in a political debate, we do not have the right to drag them into a war-casualty list. There is something severely unethical about such an action and merits attention from us.</p>
<p>We already have a degrading environment, depleting resources and are on our way to be living in an unlivable planet; and all this even without a war. So if “what we don’t call war” has caused the said damage, one can easily deduce that a war is only going to accelerate the downhill journey. Anyone among us even pretending to stand by the environment — let alone “fighting for it” should quite obviously stand by the choice of a non-violent approach to conflict, regardless of their nationality.</p>
<p>Having said all that, it is not that the non-humans need us. It is we who need our nature and all its creatures intact, mainly as support-systems they provide for our continued life on the planet and the onus is on us to protect them. Especially from human-originating violence such as wars.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Regardless of who we are; happy citizens with creature comforts; immigrants living temporarily in a place we were not born into; disgruntled citizens who are dissatisfied by their state oppression; unwilling participants from a revolution; displaced citizen living as a refugee elsewhere and what not. Regardless of who we are, we have to make the choice between violence and dialogue. Our choices will determine the next-minute on this planet.</p>
<p>War happens when we — out of our cowardice and laziness — side with the powerful and not the weak. War happens when we choose personal benefits over the human and planet’s cause. War happens when we join the frenzy and are afraid to stand alone. War happens when we stop listening to ourselves and turn subservient to the system.</p>
<p>War only pretends to be the final solution.</p>
<p>But in reality, it is the beginning.</p>
